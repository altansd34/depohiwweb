The pair have an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">inseparable bond</a> that we get to see on television all the time when Eric makes cameos on Simon’s many talent competition shows. It has us wondering if Eric will be taking over Simon’s role in the future as a talent competition judge. Watch the video below for a deep dive into their relationship and how Simon is preparing Eric for this role.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell Has Brought Eric On Set For Both ‘AGT’ And ‘BGT’</h2><p>Eric may be tiny, but he has already made his presence known on the judging panel on both ‘AGT’ and ‘BGT.’ Eric made his ‘BGT’ judging debut in 2017, with the other judges referring to Eric as “Simon’s replacement.” Eric sat on the panel in his dads lap and was obsessed with hitting the red buzzer just like his dad. We have seen Simon hit the red buzzer so many times on each talent show so that is certainly one thing he and Eric have in common.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Eric appeared on ‘BGT’ again in 2018 joining the judging panel during the Semi Finals. This time he was enamored with the microphone at the judges table and continuously shouted the word “no” which made the audience laugh. “No” happens to be one of Simon’s favorite words ever.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>MUST-SEE ADORABLE PHOTO’S OF SIMON COWELL’S SON ERIC ON HALLOWEEN</a></strong></p><p>“He’s brilliant, he comes down to the auditions and really enjoys the acts,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon told People</a> about Eric’s visits to the set. “He’s very good to watch, funnily enough, because I can see when he’s bored and when he’s up dancing.&nbsp;He’s a good critic already. He’s unpaid, but he’s helping me!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eric Is Already A Hit With The Ladies Much Like His Famous Father</h3><p>One thing we know about Simon is that he is a total ladies man. He has had numerous contestants come on the show and profess their love for him along with huge celebrity names admitting they have a crush on the 61-year-old. While Simon has settled down with Eric’s mom Lauren Silverman, he is paving the way for Eric to become the future ladies man of talent competition shows.</p><p>When five-year-old contestant Sophie Fatu auditioned for ‘AGT’ in season 13, Simon made it clear that Eric <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had a crush on her.</a> During the Judges Cuts round, he called Sophie Eric’s “girlfriend” which made him red in the face and embarrassed. So much so, that Eric ran off the set and hit Howie Mandel’s red buzzer in the process.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>After Appearing On ‘AGT’ And ‘BGT,’ Eric Landed Major Entertainment Opportunities</h3><p>At just six years old, Eric <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>landed a voice-over role</a> in the new animated “Scooby-Doo” movie, “Scoob!” along with Simon who played himself. At such a young age he is already building an extensive resume, so he is definitely following in the footsteps of his father.</p><p>Eric stole the show in 2018 during Simon’s interview with Loose Women. He continuously tickled his dad and kept poking him which was incredibly hilarious. Simon said during the interview that he would love to have Eric join him on the judging panel someday, as long as they can sit on the same side of the desk. Eric said that Simon had been drinking “annoying juice” that day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>HOW SIMON COWELL IS HELPING FORMER ‘X FACTOR’ JUDGE CHERYL WITH HER CAREER</a></strong></p><p>Simon had previously announced that he and Eric signed a seven-book deal with Hatchette books for a series called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Wishfits.” </a>It is a series about unusual mythical creatures that the pair created together. Creativity is something you need if you want to work in entertainment, and it’s definitely a trait that Eric has much like his father.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eric Is Simon’s Mini Me When It Comes To Looks</h3><p>If this all wasn’t enough to prove that Simon and Eric<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> are basically twins,</a> Simon almost named Eric after him. He was going to name him Eric Simon but instead opted for simply Eric for fear he would be bullied. Not to mention they look exactly the same and share the same fashion sense. They both love to wear white button-down shirts and even wore matching pajamas when ‘AGT’ was being filmed remotely during quarantine.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH ERIC COWELL SING TO HIS INJURED DAD, SIMON COWELL, ON HIS 61ST BIRTHDAY</a></strong></p><p>After Simon’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>electric bike accident</a> it makes us question now more than ever if Eric will take over Simon’s role on talent competition shows.
