He was born in Jos, even though his family originates from Ifite, Dunu, which is in <a href=#>Anambra State</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Peter and his twin brother Paul attended St.Murrumba secondary school, which is in Jos. This school was the first place where Peter and Paul discovered their passion for music and stage. They joined the local music and drama club, and they enjoyed their time there.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, they sung, danced, and mimicked different songs by Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown, and MC Hammer. Michael Jackson has always been the biggest inspiration for Peter and his brother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0904f61708ead7d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>600Breezy biography: age, height, real name, kids, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The brothers and their school friends formed an a-cappella quartet together, which they called “MMMPP” after the first letters of the members’ names. The boys were mostly inspired by their number one idol, Michael Jackson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5894bd82210556ef.jpg><p class=align-left>Eventually, they formed a dancing and singing group, called “Smooth Criminals”. As for “MMMPP”, when one of the members, M-Clef, left the band, the name was changed to “MMPP”.</p><p class=align-left>Still, Peter, his brother Paul and other members of the group became very popular in Jos thanks to their large artistic talent and complicated dance routines. They were often invited to perform at school events and many other occasions.</p><p class=align-left>Inspired by such a huge success, Peter and Paul went to music school to learn to play multiple music instruments – drums, keyboard, rhythm guitar, and bass. Since the boys were naturally gifted, there were no difficulties.</p><p class=align-left>Aside for being incredible dancers, they are also great musicians. Peter Okoye has worked together with his brother Paul during the production of multiple movie soundtracks, such as <i>“Mama Sunday”, “Tobi”, “Evas River”, </i>and<i> “Moment of Bitterness”.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c7ff5328c3bcf7b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Ralph Macchio’s wife Phyllis Fierro?

They studied Business Administration at University of Abuja in 1999.</p><p class=align-left>Their band, “Smooth Criminals”, was disbanded because the members also left for different universities across the country. However, the brothers decided to form their own music band, with only two of them.</p><p class=align-left>At first, Peter and Paul went through many different name options – “P&P”, “Double P”, and “Da Pees”. Eventually, they settled on the name “P-Square”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0904f61708ead7d3.jpg><p class=align-left>The brothers found themselves a manager Bayo Odusami, also known as Howie T. He was a well-known concert promoter and CEO of Adrot Nigeria Ltd. Under his management, the brothers went on to participate in different competitions and demonstrated their talent to the wide Nigerian public.</p><p class=align-left>2001 was an event-packed year for Peter and Paul. This was when the band won the competition <i>“Grab Da Mic”</i>, which earned them sponsorship of their debut album from <i>Benson & Hughes</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Their first album had the title<i> “Last Nite” </i>and was released under the Timbuk2 music label.

This album was a huge sensation which was sold all over Nigeria. The first video for this album was number one at the MTV Base chart for four consecutive weeks.</p><p class=align-left>Throughout their career, the brothers managed to cooperate with many notable artists, such as Ginuwine, Akon, and Sean Paul. In 2007, they announced the release of their album<i> “Game Over”, </i>which became their best-selling album ever. It sold a total of eight million copies worldwide.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d96ee41f85fbaff4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How Taron Egerton started his acting career and the movies he starred in</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Two years later, in 2009, they released yet another studio album, called<i> “Danger”. </i>There are a lot of collaborations on this album with other popular Nigerian artists, for instance, 2Face Idibia, Frenzy, and J Martins. Critics described their first single <i>“Danger” </i>as a dancing hip-hop song which also has a lot of cutting synthes along with the strong baseline.</p><p class=align-left>The twins Peter and Paul are also well-known for their strong resemblance to the R&B star from the United States, Usher Raymond.</p><p class=align-left>In 2010, Peter and Paul’s group “P-Square” was named the <i>“Artist of the Year”</i> at the Kora Awards in Burkina Faso.

This entertaining TV show brought dancers from all around the world and gave them a chance to demonstrate their talents and win amazing prizes.</p><p class=align-left>However, in 2016, news appeared that Globacom made a decision to terminate their ambassadorship deal with the P-Square twins. The alleged reason for such a turn was that Peter Okoye fell out with a representative of the company during the finale of the<i> “Dance with Peter” </i>talent show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3234fd237e8d009b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Juicy facts about Heidi Klum's hot new husband, Tom Kaulitz</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Peter Okoye, as well as his brother Paul, has sometimes been a part of other controversial stories. For instance, the musicians have been accused of using samples of popular hits and western songs in their music.</p><p class=align-left>Obviously, the duo has addressed this issue in the multiple interviews. They said that they are mostly inspired from the music samples of the songs and try to reconstruct them, instead of directly sampling these songs in their own music. This is why Peter and Paul’s sounds largely feel electronic, for instance,<i> “Game Over”, “Get Squared”,</i> and<i> “Danger”.</i></p><h2>The P-Square fallout and Peter’s solo career</h2><p class=align-left>Although the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Okoye brothers</a> have always seemed very close to each other (they even bought luxurious mansions in Atlanta right next to each other!), in fact, they have had their fair share of creative differences, which later resulted into issues that could not be discussed peacefully.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/19a774815d798236.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of top striker Sergio Aguero will inspire you!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The twins had<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> a disagreement </a>in 2017, and originally, it was over their manager’s role, who is coincidentally their family member – their older brother, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jude Okoye</a>.
