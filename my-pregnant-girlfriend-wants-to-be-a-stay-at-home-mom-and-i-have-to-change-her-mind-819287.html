All of&nbsp;that being said, having a&nbsp;parent stay home is&nbsp;not always the best choice for couples. A&nbsp;man had a&nbsp;disagreement with his girlfriend when she told him she’d like to&nbsp;quit her <a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;their future child. He&nbsp;believes he&nbsp;has good reasons to&nbsp;object to&nbsp;his partner’s wish.</p><h2>A man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> his dilemma on Reddit.</h2><p>My&nbsp;(29M) girlfriend (23F) Emily and&nbsp;I have been dating for four years and have lived together since last October.</p><p>She graduated from college last year and was able to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;job that paid an&nbsp;okay salary for an&nbsp;entry-level position. She didn’t like the job too much, but she mentioned that it&nbsp;had good opportunities for promotions and would look good on&nbsp;her resume, so&nbsp;she hoped to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;to&nbsp;more interesting work that she is&nbsp;more passionate about soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6f/e6f/3406285602a66b69a065ae886e.jpg><p>This January, my girlfriend became pregnant with a girl by accident. It was unplanned, and we considered abortion but decided to keep the baby. We have since been preparing for the birth. We have good <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a> with both my and her parents, and both sets of parents have said they would be willing to babysit our daughter for free.</p><p>Recently, my girlfriend told me that she would like to quit her job after the baby is born to be a stay-at-home mom. Her reasons for doing so were:</p><li>She is getting very attached to our baby even though it’s not born yet, and the idea of dropping her off with a babysitter, even if that babysitter is one of our parents who we know will take good care of it, makes her want to cry.</li><li>Her mom was a SAHM, which allowed her to have home-cooked meals every day and do lots of fun stuff that she couldn’t do with a babysitter. She wants to provide the same experience for our daughter.</li><li>She no longer likes her job and is unsure if she even wants to continue down the same career path. She regrets her major in accounting and wishes she had majored in something she is passionate about instead of something that just makes good money.</li><li>I recently got a promotion to a <a href=# title=supervisory data-link=tag>supervisory</a> position in my company that came with a pay raise of nearly forty thousand dollars, so I can afford to support her and our daughter.</li><li>She didn’t say it, but one of her friends recently gave birth and became a SAHM, so I’m sure that influenced her decision.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/172/193/06480a56f28d4508ab0edd291c.jpg><p>I&nbsp;said no&nbsp;for a&nbsp;few reasons:</p><li>We&nbsp;were planning to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;house in&nbsp;the next couple of&nbsp;years, and with me&nbsp;being the only one working, that would set&nbsp;us back by&nbsp;years in&nbsp;getting one.</li><li>I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;poor. During my&nbsp;entire childhood, I&nbsp;only went to&nbsp;the movie theater a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times because my&nbsp;parents could not afford to&nbsp;take me&nbsp;out to&nbsp;do&nbsp;fun stuff like that often, for example. I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;new pair of&nbsp;shoes once a&nbsp;year and bought my&nbsp;clothes from Walmart.<br>With both our incomes, we&nbsp;have been able to&nbsp;enjoy a&nbsp;very nice <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a>. We&nbsp;both drive nice new cars, go&nbsp;shopping, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;nice restaurants or&nbsp;the movies regularly, and have also been on&nbsp;some nice trips and vacations. With only one income, we&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;curtail our spending by&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot. My&nbsp;GF&nbsp;brought this&nbsp;up, but&nbsp;I don’t really want&nbsp;to.<br>With both of&nbsp;us working, we&nbsp;can keep our current lifestyle even after the baby. There are many things&nbsp;I still want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and places&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to. And we&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;put all our life plans on&nbsp;hold for several years, since my&nbsp;income alone would not be&nbsp;enough. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;wait until&nbsp;I got even more raises, or&nbsp;saved for a&nbsp;long time.</li><li>I&nbsp;just don’t want the pressure of&nbsp;being the only person to&nbsp;provide for my&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a></li><li>Most people don’t like their jobs, from what she told&nbsp;me, she mainly just does not like her boss and finds the work boring. My&nbsp;mom had to&nbsp;work a&nbsp;physically difficult job while&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;baby. So&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;her and many other women my&nbsp;girlfriend has it&nbsp;easy. Sometimes you just have to&nbsp;suck up&nbsp;having a&nbsp;job you don’t like.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ef/204/f69f765a06854ffd95dc0d9ef6.jpg><p>Also, while telling her&nbsp;no, I&nbsp;might have said that the reason why she was feeling so&nbsp;attached to&nbsp;the baby was <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> hormones, and they would soon pass. So&nbsp;yeah, not my&nbsp;best choice of&nbsp;words. I&nbsp;mentioned this to&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends and my&nbsp;family.</p><p>I’ve been told by&nbsp;some people that a&nbsp;true man provides for his family. And that I’m evil for wanting to&nbsp;separate a&nbsp;mother from her baby when&nbsp;I could afford to&nbsp;let her stay home. So&nbsp;am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong?</p><p><h2>The commenters were on&nbsp;the poster’s side and understood where he&nbsp;was coming from.</h2></p><ul><li>“This whole post shows how woefully unprepared you and your girl are for having a&nbsp;kid.
