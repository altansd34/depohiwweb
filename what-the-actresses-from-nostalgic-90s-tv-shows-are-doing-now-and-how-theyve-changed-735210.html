The main female characters of&nbsp;these long stories were real role models for&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;beautiful and stylish as&nbsp;they were. Who didn’t want to&nbsp;have the same blond hair as&nbsp;Eden did? Or&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;business-like as&nbsp;Stephanie Harper from Return to&nbsp;Eden. And, of&nbsp;course, all of&nbsp;us dreamed about the guys that all these women were so&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;meet.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;reminisce about the actresses who played the main heroines of&nbsp;the iconic&nbsp;TV series from the 90s and to&nbsp;find out what their life has been like since then.</p><p><h2>Cybill Shepherd, Moonlighting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/673/720/66f18b55f89abba550e0b93e0c.jpg><p>Maddie Hayes, the main character of&nbsp;the <strong>Moonlighting TV&nbsp;series</strong> and a&nbsp;chic and smart former high-fashion model, becomes the manager of&nbsp;a&nbsp;detective agency and an&nbsp;amateur sleuth. This became Cybill Shepherd’s most memorable part. It&nbsp;brought her a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fans and 2&nbsp;Golden Globes. It’s impossible to&nbsp;forget her wheat-blond hair, stylish outfits, and her brilliant banter with her on-screen partner, Bruce Willis.</p><p>Cybill is&nbsp;now 69&nbsp;years old, but she continues to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>. However, none of&nbsp;her following work became as&nbsp;popular as&nbsp;her role in&nbsp;Moonlighting. On&nbsp;the photo to&nbsp;the right, you can see Cybill’s latest part in&nbsp;the 2017 movie <a href=#>Being Rose</a>.</p><p><h2>Gillian Anderson, The X-Files</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d4/b8a/368d435283bfc94a9a92da957a.jpg><p>Thanks to&nbsp;the style of&nbsp;the FBI agent Dana Scully in&nbsp;<strong>The X-Files</strong>, red hair and a&nbsp;bob haircut became really popular in&nbsp;the 90s. The character was played by&nbsp;Gillian Anderson in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series and in&nbsp;2&nbsp;movies, The X-Files and The X-Files: I&nbsp;Want to&nbsp;Believe and it&nbsp;brought her worldwide fame.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2000s, Gillian returned to&nbsp;a&nbsp;theater stage, and she also took part in&nbsp;some&nbsp;TV shows and movies. The new 2016 season of&nbsp;The X-Files TV&nbsp;series was well-received by&nbsp;viewers. In&nbsp;2019, Gillian will play the part of&nbsp;Prime Minister of&nbsp;the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher in&nbsp;the historical movie The Crown.</p><p><h2>Lara Flynn Boyle, Twin Peaks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/719/ae0/eac4dc5e0080693901dd1f63b7.jpg><p>Lara Flynn Boyle’s part of&nbsp;Donna in&nbsp;the iconic <strong>Twin Peaks</strong> TV&nbsp;series made the actress famous. After that, she received many offers from movie directors. For example, she played one of&nbsp;the main parts in&nbsp;Men in&nbsp;Black II&nbsp;and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few famous television shows.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 2000s, Lara’s career began to&nbsp;go&nbsp;downhill. Currently, she mainly works on&nbsp;low-budget movies. This happened due to&nbsp;her experiments with plastic surgery which made her appearance almost unrecognizable.</p><p><h2>Sherilyn Fenn, Twin Peaks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07b/639/cc98bc5be8991e327beadd6e4f.jpg><p>Her part of&nbsp;the hot beauty, Audrey Horne, on&nbsp;the <strong>Twin Peaks</strong> TV&nbsp;series made Sherilyn Fenn the sex symbol of&nbsp;the 90s. The actress had a&nbsp;gorgeous natural beauty, and many people even compared her to&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>There are more than 100 parts in&nbsp;Fenn’s filmography, but she never became really famous in&nbsp;Hollywood. 25&nbsp;years after the first premier of&nbsp;the Twin Peaks TV&nbsp;series, Fenn played a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;the Twin Peaks sequel in&nbsp;2017.</p><p><h2>Hélène Rollès, Hélène et&nbsp;les Garçons (Helen and the Boys)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/358/78d/4db7bf5a3286ea1bd3f6cb6320.jpg><p>Hélène Rollès played the main part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;French sitcom about student life called Helen and the Guys.</p><p>The actress is&nbsp;52&nbsp;now. After Helen and the Guys, she took part in&nbsp;3&nbsp;sequels of&nbsp;this sitcom: The Miracle of&nbsp;Love, Holidays of&nbsp;Love, and <a href=#>Mysteries of&nbsp;Love</a> (2011-2018). Besides acting, Hélène Rollès is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;musician and has recorded a&nbsp;few albums.

The viewers remembered Eden thanks to&nbsp;her impeccable image and passionate love with her on-screen partner, policeman Cruz Castillo acted by&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Martinez.</p><p>After Santa Barbara was finished, Marcy acted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few other soap operas. In&nbsp;2005, she announced that she was planning on&nbsp;ending her acting career to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;pastor. She’s currently serving as&nbsp;the LifeKIDS <a href=#>Pastor</a> for Life Church in&nbsp;Edmond, Oklahoma. She has an&nbsp;adult son who’s trying out acting too.</p><p><h2>Heather Locklear, Dynasty and Melrose Place</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d0/3ae/3f79b35209a39a41c0d190ce04.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 80s and 90s, Heather Locklear used to&nbsp;play vampy women for the most part. Her characters in&nbsp;<strong>Dynasty</strong> and <strong>Melrose Place</strong> were exactly like this. The part of&nbsp;Amanda Woodward in&nbsp;Melrose Place, who was a&nbsp;heartbreaker and a&nbsp;schemer, became her greatest success. Heather received 4&nbsp;consecutive Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress&nbsp;— Television Series Drama.</p><p>In&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 2000s, her career slowed <a href=# title=down data-link=tag>down</a>. But even now her name appears in&nbsp;the media from time to&nbsp;time due to&nbsp;<a href=#>problems</a> in&nbsp;her personal life, bad plastic surgery, long bout with depression, and attempted suicides.</p><p><h2>Tori Spelling, Beverly Hills, 90210</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/314/77e/65ba1c57b89f728c6723994bca.jpg><p>Tori Spelling became famous thanks to&nbsp;the part of&nbsp;Donna Martin in&nbsp;the iconic teen drama&nbsp;TV series Beverly Hills, 90210. She cast for this part when she was 17. She acted in&nbsp;all 10&nbsp;seasons from 1990 to&nbsp;2000.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 2000s, Tori acted in&nbsp;movies like Scary Movie&nbsp;2, Sol Goode, and Naked Movie.

However, the part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot lifeguard on&nbsp;<strong>Baywatch</strong> is&nbsp;probably one of&nbsp;her most recognizable roles.</p><p>Electra is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;musician and has recorded 2&nbsp;albums. She had a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;fitness DVDs too. Though she is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;demand in&nbsp;Hollywood, she is&nbsp;more focused on&nbsp;charity work now.
