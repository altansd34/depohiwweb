That’s why, recently, philosophical literature has been avidly discussing the new, very real <a href=#>question</a>: Can grown children ignore their filial obligation? This question appeared because many people are afraid to&nbsp;say “no” to&nbsp;their parents and are ready to&nbsp;sacrifice their own interests and dreams just not to&nbsp;hear their reproaches. For this reason, there are many people who don’t live the life they want and who become hostages of&nbsp;feelings of&nbsp;guilt and debt that are actually impossible to&nbsp;repay.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;touch on&nbsp;this serious topic and help grown kids understand where that thin line between gratitude and voluntary self-sacrifice is.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;wouldn’t exist without you, but my&nbsp;birth was your choice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/151/339/c82f1757f8a2a3cc99106d1260.jpeg><p>The favorite phrase of&nbsp;manipulator-parents goes like this: “I&nbsp;carried you for 9&nbsp;months, I&nbsp;didn’t sleep at&nbsp;night, and&nbsp;I never even left your crib&nbsp;— where is&nbsp;your gratitude now?” But those are pretty natural things that each woman who decided to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother does, aren’t they?</p><p>A&nbsp;kid doesn’t even suspect that they might have to&nbsp;pay back all the care and warmth they are getting now. And when they are asked to&nbsp;return the debt, the love for the parents will gradually start to&nbsp;fade away and a&nbsp;mutual reproach will arise that will later grow into a&nbsp;disappointment in&nbsp;each other.</p><p>Claims and demands for an&nbsp;adult kid appear when the birth of&nbsp;the baby was supposed to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;guarantor of&nbsp;certain expectations that were placed on&nbsp;this child. In&nbsp;loving families, caring is&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural thing and parents take care of&nbsp;the new family member as&nbsp;something natural, that’s why there won’t be&nbsp;any need to&nbsp;ask for a&nbsp;child’s gratitude in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;have given you so&nbsp;much and I&nbsp;am sorry if&nbsp;that remained unnoticed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc9/333/da386e5c5781c99c7cd4a46a7d.jpg><p>From the very first minutes of&nbsp;their life, a&nbsp;kid gives their parents everything they have: their look, their hugs, their first words, their crafts, etc. But parents need to&nbsp;have the strength and desire to&nbsp;notice everything their kid does for them. If&nbsp;the little things go&nbsp;unnoticed and if&nbsp;adults are sure that it’s only necessary to&nbsp;fulfill their kid’s basic needs, it’s not surprising that this kid won’t feel a&nbsp;strong bond with their family in&nbsp;the future. Needless to&nbsp;say that the desire to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;elderly parents might not appear at&nbsp;all. In&nbsp;the best-case scenario, the adult kid might continue to&nbsp;fulfill their parents’ basic needs by&nbsp;buying products, medicine, and paying for their communal facilities, while at&nbsp;the same time trying to&nbsp;show up&nbsp;in&nbsp;their home as&nbsp;seldom as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>Parents don’t always become your closest people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2b/7e9/be03ae511b9a79ac7de650bcb6.jpg><p>Parents undoubtedly play an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;each person’s life, but this doesn’t mean they are the only people in&nbsp;the whole world their kid can rely&nbsp;on. Unfortunately, the opposite situation might take place too&nbsp;— like when kids and parents have a&nbsp;misunderstanding, feel there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;support, or&nbsp;that their parents are ignoring their issues. Additionally, critiques from parents can hurt even more than critiques from a&nbsp;stranger, and it&nbsp;worsens the situation even more.</p><p>Despite some people’s attempts to&nbsp;honor their parents no&nbsp;matter what, one should assess the situation soberly&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you are facing neglect, humiliation, and you don’t have a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;share your worries with your parents, then this is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;relationship between loved ones. Don’t live in&nbsp;this illusionary world: if&nbsp;you were not supported from childhood, the odds are high that you won’t get any support in&nbsp;your adult life either. In&nbsp;this case, this person has the full right to&nbsp;refuse to&nbsp;support their parents because they never saw this support from them.</p><p>On&nbsp;the contrary, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent unconditionally gave all their love to&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, when the kid grows&nbsp;up, they won’t feel the need to&nbsp;repay something, and the manifestation of&nbsp;care from the kid’s side will become a&nbsp;natural expression of&nbsp;all those feelings that they have accumulated over the years.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>friendship theory</a> that says kids should be&nbsp;giving the same things to&nbsp;their parents as&nbsp;they do&nbsp;to&nbsp;their friends, because friendship relationships are sustained voluntarily. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent and a&nbsp;kid don’t share emotions with each other, then there shouldn’t be&nbsp;any filial obligations.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;won’t become the person you want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/9ed/c01/ab827e5d908aedc33d0a03f949.jpeg><p>Parents might have some ideas about your future, but they should never interfere with the realization of&nbsp;your own ideas. Being an&nbsp;adult means choosing your way by&nbsp;yourself and it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the life experience of&nbsp;your parents or&nbsp;it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;totally different.</p><p>From an&nbsp;early age, a&nbsp;kid knows what they want but if&nbsp;parents keep making choices for them, they will grow into an&nbsp;adult who will be&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;making mistakes and who will be&nbsp;always dependent on&nbsp;their circumstances and transfer the responsibility for their life to&nbsp;other people.</p><p>If&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;your own decision-making just for the sake of&nbsp;meeting your parents’ expectations, this means you’re pretending to&nbsp;be&nbsp;someone else&nbsp;— someone you actually are not. Sacrificing your dreams for family expectations is&nbsp;the best way to&nbsp;generate resentment, anger, and pain and live with these feelings for the rest of&nbsp;your life.</p><p>Healthy relationships in&nbsp;the family let&nbsp;us be&nbsp;ourselves. If&nbsp;your situation is&nbsp;different, it&nbsp;high time you discuss this and set boundaries.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;won’t give you my&nbsp;time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f28/4fc/33f6a152c09e31fa05f71e9476.jpg><p>Oftentimes, the wish to&nbsp;spend every second with their kid appears because parents don’t have their own goals and interests in&nbsp;life. And sometimes when a&nbsp;child grows&nbsp;up, this results in&nbsp;the parents demanding the same amount of&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;themselves as&nbsp;the kid had in&nbsp;their childhood.</p><p>However, if&nbsp;we’re talking about a&nbsp;normal situation, kids grow up&nbsp;and start their life, while parents stay with each other and their personal achievements for the entire growing-up period of&nbsp;the baby. The issue of&nbsp;the parents who didn’t want to&nbsp;settle in&nbsp;their life is&nbsp;that their grown kids, who want freedom, are now the “glue,” without which everything in&nbsp;the family will fall apart.</p><p>The kid will decide themselves what kind of&nbsp;help they are ready to&nbsp;give and demanding more from them doesn’t make any sense. No&nbsp;matter how many kids and grandkids a&nbsp;person has, they should, first of&nbsp;all, be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;themselves on&nbsp;their own.</p><p><h2>And I&nbsp;can’t give you back your time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/178/517/d1733d5c89b1ae9a9126318355.jpg><p>Being offended by&nbsp;the kid for not “paying off their expenses” appears in&nbsp;cases where a&nbsp;parent wasn’t able to&nbsp;realize their potential in&nbsp;their desired sphere, and it&nbsp;seems that the appearance of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby “caused” them to&nbsp;lose all their potential and prevented them from reaching certain goals. A&nbsp;kid cannot return the time that a&nbsp;parent didn’t dare to&nbsp;spend on&nbsp;themselves.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, within the first few years of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid’s life, almost all the time of&nbsp;their parents is&nbsp;dedicated to&nbsp;them but the way parents manage their time in&nbsp;the future depends only on&nbsp;them. If&nbsp;for some reason, the role of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;parent didn’t bring them any pleasure, a&nbsp;parent might start to&nbsp;look for the guilty one who “stole the best years of&nbsp;their life.” This results in&nbsp;the appearance of&nbsp;the offense, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the demand for the kid to&nbsp;compensate for all the things their parents lost.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;few statistics</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05b/1e9/7f709556ae975e9338557b95c8.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>research</a> by&nbsp;American sociologists, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big difference between the level of&nbsp;financial support that parents expect to&nbsp;receive and the help that children plan to&nbsp;provide: 92% of&nbsp;surveyed parents said that they don’t expect any financial support from their children in&nbsp;retirement, only&nbsp;1% expect full support, 2%&nbsp;expect that their children will bear most of&nbsp;the costs, and&nbsp;5% said that their children will provide support as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Despite the fact that most parents don’t expect any support, 63% of&nbsp;kids said that they are planning to&nbsp;help their retired parents financially.&nbsp;61% are ready to&nbsp;let their parents live with them when they stop working.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4c/7d8/cb60a85fc1a05c838723facc5a.jpg><p>The best thing that parents can do&nbsp;for their kids is&nbsp;to&nbsp;give them freedom and the opportunity to&nbsp;live their life. If&nbsp;you let your kid learn from their own mistakes; if&nbsp;you respect your kid’s choice and wishes; if&nbsp;you support, help, and don’t impose your opinion, these kids will grow into people with a&nbsp;natural feeling of&nbsp;gratitude and responsibility. If&nbsp;at&nbsp;the same time parents were spending time on&nbsp;themselves, they will never have a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;living a&nbsp;“wasted life.”</p><p>Keep in&nbsp;mind that a&nbsp;kid copies the behavior of&nbsp;their parents&nbsp;— the very moment you need some help, look at&nbsp;your own reflection in&nbsp;the mirror and see what kind of&nbsp;person you used to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think kids have filial obligations to&nbsp;their parents?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYykoJ2rXZm8r8CMqK6eZZGjxrW0yKeeZqyfYsGpscirZKmZopq7tb%2BMcHBycWdofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-kids-dont-owe-anything-to-their-parents-799973.html&text=Why%20Kids%20Dont%20Owe%20Anything%20to%20Their%20Parents&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-kids-dont-owe-anything-to-their-parents-799973.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-kids-dont-owe-anything-to-their-parents-799973.html&title=Why%20Kids%20Dont%20Owe%20Anything%20to%20Their%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-kids-dont-owe-anything-to-their-parents-799973.html&title=Why%20Kids%20Dont%20Owe%20Anything%20to%20Their%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-kids-dont-owe-anything-to-their-parents-799973.html&title=Why%20Kids%20Dont%20Owe%20Anything%20to%20Their%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-kids-dont-owe-anything-to-their-parents-799973.html&description=Why%20Kids%20Dont%20Owe%20Anything%20to%20Their%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-this-the-big-bang-theory-star-dumped-his-wife-before-marrying-her-813216.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why This The Big Bang Theory Star Dumped His Wife Before Marrying Her">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./agt-finale-who-was-crowned-the-winner-of-season-14.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Crowned The Winner Of Season 14?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
