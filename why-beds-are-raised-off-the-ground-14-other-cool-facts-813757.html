Back in&nbsp;the 19th century, money was made of&nbsp;parchment paper. That’s why people could very easily counterfeit&nbsp;it, unlike now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/074/4d8/d95b4e5fd4bd8be721e8fb5c3f.jpeg><p>The <a href=# title="Eiffel Tower" data-link=tag>Eiffel Tower</a> is&nbsp;almost 6&nbsp;inches taller during the summer. When you heat up&nbsp;some substance, its particles start to&nbsp;move more actively and take up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger volume. That’s something they call thermal expansion. When the temperature lowers, the substance contracts again.</p><p>Such an&nbsp;effect is&nbsp;more prominent in&nbsp;gases, but you can also track it&nbsp;in&nbsp;liquids and solids&nbsp;— including iron. Because of&nbsp;this, people build large structures, like bridges, using expansion joints. They allow a&nbsp;structure some leeway to&nbsp;expand and contract, and such changes don’t cause any damage. Wow. I&nbsp;have some pants like that.</p><p>Honey can last for thousands of&nbsp;years without going bad. Bees land on&nbsp;flowers to&nbsp;collect sugary nectar. Then they transport it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;their hive and transfer it&nbsp;to&nbsp;other worker bees. These bees reduce the water content of&nbsp;the nectar by&nbsp;repeatedly drinking and regurgitating the liquid. Hmm. Bee Barf.</p><p>Special enzymes in&nbsp;their stomachs break down the glucose in&nbsp;the nectar, and it&nbsp;becomes more acidic. Bees deposit this nectar in&nbsp;the honeycomb and start fanning it&nbsp;with their wings so&nbsp;that the water evaporates more quickly. The honey is&nbsp;now highly acidic and low in&nbsp;water content, which keeps it&nbsp;safe from spoiling. The bacteria that cause the rest of&nbsp;the food to&nbsp;go&nbsp;off can’t survive in&nbsp;such conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d94/d56/c530c95318a6307fc8adddd690.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;long time ago, people didn’t elevate their mattresses off the floor. This practice started in&nbsp;Ancient Egypt and continued in&nbsp;many other cultures. People realized it&nbsp;was cold on&nbsp;the floor, and they could warm their beds easier if&nbsp;they were off the ground. Houses used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more draughty. Cold air came in&nbsp;from under the doors.</p><p>There was no&nbsp;central heating, so&nbsp;people had to&nbsp;find other ways to&nbsp;stay warm. Warm air tends to&nbsp;rise. And if&nbsp;you’re positioned higher, you won’t be&nbsp;as&nbsp;cold as&nbsp;on&nbsp;the floor. Also, this way, people could keep their beds clean more easily. In&nbsp;simple homes, floors used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;way dirtier than today, and all that dirt usually migrated into beds.</p><p>Continuing now to&nbsp;talk dirty, do&nbsp;you think people are naturally clean and tidy? After all, our ancestors, who lived thousands of&nbsp;years ago, already used latrines and were tidying their hair with combs. And they kept their homes and themselves clean. Our natural need for hygiene and cleanliness is&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;our sense of&nbsp;disgust.</p><p>That’s the very mechanism that helps our bodies stay safe and protects them from different infections. That’s why we’re more sensitive to&nbsp;certain smells and things. But we&nbsp;still have some pretty sloppy habits. For example, eating snacks over a&nbsp;<a href=# title=keyboard data-link=tag>keyboard</a>. Eww! I&nbsp;certainly never do&nbsp;that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/102/eb8/e16e6851adbf37ed92f5a10ff4.jpeg><p>But there are <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a> that are even neater than&nbsp;us, humans. For example, rattlesnakes like to&nbsp;keep their surroundings tidy. Some of&nbsp;them even use their muscular necks and triangular heads to&nbsp;sweep aside messy grass when they hunt.</p><p>Many animals like to&nbsp;clear their path when going after their future meal&nbsp;— reptiles too. Less vegetation increases their chances of&nbsp;catching food. Songbirds also prefer to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;neat and get rid of&nbsp;uneaten food, eggshells, or&nbsp;other trash in&nbsp;their nests. This way, they also make their homes less visible to&nbsp;their enemies.</p><p>Meanwhile, out in&nbsp;space, shadows are darker on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a> than on&nbsp;our planet. That’s because the atmosphere on&nbsp;Earth scatters more sunlight. But if&nbsp;you could visit the Moon, you’d observe shadows so&nbsp;dark you wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see where you were going.</p><p>Also, you’d notice fresh footprints on&nbsp;the lunar surface. People haven’t set foot there in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few decades, but the footprints look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were left just yesterday. Since there’s no&nbsp;water or&nbsp;wind on&nbsp;the Moon, nothing can erase these footprints. So&nbsp;they can stay there in&nbsp;their original form for millions of&nbsp;years. So&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful where you step, huh?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5f3/ce0/35fcfc50a98058bc571c1f0a0e.jpeg><p>Earth’s core contains enough <a href=# title=gold data-link=tag>gold</a> to&nbsp;coat the entire planet. And if&nbsp;you decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, the level of&nbsp;this precious metal would be&nbsp;knee-high. For thousands of&nbsp;years, people have been mining gold and platinum, together with a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;other precious minerals, from underneath our planet’s surface. That’s why we&nbsp;may have depleted some of&nbsp;the minerals in&nbsp;certain areas.</p><p>But Earth still has a&nbsp;huge number of&nbsp;such deposits, especially if&nbsp;you get closer to&nbsp;its core. That’s because of&nbsp;countless meteorites that collided with our planet during the period of&nbsp;its formation. Those meteorites contained different minerals, including gold.</p><p>Back then, Earth was still in&nbsp;its molten state, which is&nbsp;why most of&nbsp;the gold&nbsp;— a&nbsp;heavy element&nbsp;— sank deep to&nbsp;its core. And the silicate mantle positioned over the core trapped really huge amounts of&nbsp;gold and some other minerals. Unfortunately, most of&nbsp;them are kinda out-of-reach now&nbsp;— since we&nbsp;talk about 1,800 miles below the surface and temperatures of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;degrees. Too hot, in&nbsp;other words.</p><p>Sure, if&nbsp;you were about to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;space, one of&nbsp;the first things you’d think of&nbsp;would be&nbsp;your space suit. But do&nbsp;you know that it’s possible to&nbsp;survive in&nbsp;space even if&nbsp;you aren’t wearing any protection? Well, don’t get your hopes up&nbsp;yet&nbsp;— you’d last for no&nbsp;more than 15&nbsp;seconds. That’s how long it’d take you to&nbsp;lose consciousness because oxygen will stop coming to&nbsp;your brain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/51a/b9f/22812c57598bb5fe8752639bf9.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;1965, one technician accidentally depressurized his suit inside a&nbsp;vacuum chamber. He&nbsp;lost consciousness after 12&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;seconds.&nbsp;27&nbsp;seconds later, his suit, luckily, got repressurized. The man later said that he&nbsp;remembered the moisture on&nbsp;his tongue starting to&nbsp;boil. He&nbsp;also lost his sense of&nbsp;taste, and it&nbsp;didn’t come back until four days after the accident.</p><p>You can’t hold your breath in&nbsp;space either, so&nbsp;that won’t save you. Your lungs will rupture at&nbsp;one point because the air inside will expand. The oxygen in&nbsp;other parts of&nbsp;your body will start to&nbsp;expand too, which means you will balloon up&nbsp;to&nbsp;twice your regular size. Almost like Dudley Dursley’s Aunt Marge from Harry Potter. Well not quite.</p><p>You won’t explode only thanks to&nbsp;your elastic skin&nbsp;— it&nbsp;will keep holding you together. And the liquids in&nbsp;your body will start vaporizing pretty quickly too. Doesn’t that sound pleasant? No!</p><p>The ocean has its iconic blue color thanks to&nbsp;sunlight. When the sun shines, the water absorbs longer orange and red wavelengths of&nbsp;light and reflects shorter, blue light waves. This is&nbsp;only possible when there’s a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;water. So, the more water you have in&nbsp;one place, the bluer it&nbsp;becomes. That’s why the water you pour in&nbsp;your glass has nothing in&nbsp;common with this beautiful ocean-blue color.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/6e1/81e/996fa85651bf1ba3549be7676d.jpeg><p>The ocean performs many important functions. For one thing, it&nbsp;produces <strong>50&nbsp;to&nbsp;80&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;all the oxygen</strong> on&nbsp;our planet, which means it&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;us alive. But it&nbsp;also helps the Internet to&nbsp;function!</p><p>So, when you’re laughing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;funny dog video or&nbsp;binge-watching your favorite series&nbsp;— yup, thank the ocean for that. The majority of&nbsp;the cables that power the Internet&nbsp;— and, therefore, allow people from all over the world to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;— run underwater. Those are “submarine communications cables”&nbsp;— miles and miles of&nbsp;wiring crisscrossing the ocean floor.</p><p>There are special boats for putting all that in&nbsp;place&nbsp;— they’re designed specifically for that purpose. To&nbsp;make sure nothing damages the cables&nbsp;— and your Internet&nbsp;— people need to&nbsp;put them on&nbsp;relatively flat stretches of&nbsp;the ocean floor. The cables also need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;away from old shipwrecks or&nbsp;large ocean ecosystems. Some of&nbsp;these cables have a&nbsp;special coating that protects them from damage. This way, no&nbsp;hungry sharks or&nbsp;curious fish have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;munch on&nbsp;the wiring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5ff/471/8a6929549391a72109840b124f.jpeg><p>Trees talk. Well, not exactly like people&nbsp;do, but they have their own way of&nbsp;communication. Their roots are connected through an&nbsp;underground network of&nbsp;fungi. That network got the nickname “the wood wide web.” Ha.</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;this network, trees can share resources with one another. That’s how they “talk.” They use these fungi to&nbsp;transmit nutrients and water from one tree to&nbsp;another. For example, there’s a&nbsp;mother tree or&nbsp;another tree that’s stronger and older than others in&nbsp;the forest. Then it&nbsp;shares some of&nbsp;its nutrients and sugars with small trees growing nearby. Thanks, Mom.</p><p>Look at&nbsp;all these insects flying around on&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice sunny day. Do&nbsp;you think they get sunburned? Well, those that spend most of&nbsp;their time in&nbsp;the open don’t. They have dark exoskeletons that contain melanin&nbsp;— that’s how they block&nbsp;UV rays.</p><p>But insects that live underground and in&nbsp;the water or&nbsp;nocturnal creatures have paler and thinner skin. If&nbsp;they spend too much time outside during the day, they can indeed get sunburned or&nbsp;even worse. They could get eaten.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYybnJ2rXZa%2FpnnRmqCsnZRivKeyjK2fnmWXp7y2usNmaG1ln6m1pr6MnKaopF2brqTA0mZvamtnaoRw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-beds-are-raised-off-the-ground-14-other-cool-facts-813757.html&text=Why%20Beds%20Are%20Raised%20Off%20the%20Ground%20%2b%2014%20Other%20Cool%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-beds-are-raised-off-the-ground-14-other-cool-facts-813757.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-beds-are-raised-off-the-ground-14-other-cool-facts-813757.html&title=Why%20Beds%20Are%20Raised%20Off%20the%20Ground%20%2b%2014%20Other%20Cool%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-beds-are-raised-off-the-ground-14-other-cool-facts-813757.html&title=Why%20Beds%20Are%20Raised%20Off%20the%20Ground%20%2b%2014%20Other%20Cool%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-beds-are-raised-off-the-ground-14-other-cool-facts-813757.html&title=Why%20Beds%20Are%20Raised%20Off%20the%20Ground%20%2b%2014%20Other%20Cool%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-beds-are-raised-off-the-ground-14-other-cool-facts-813757.html&description=Why%20Beds%20Are%20Raised%20Off%20the%20Ground%20%2b%2014%20Other%20Cool%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1554928-young-actresses-20-talented-celebrities-watch-for.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Young actresses under 20: 20 talented celebrities to watch out for">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./33858-what-kind-brit-banks-fintech.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What kind of Brit banks with a fintech?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
