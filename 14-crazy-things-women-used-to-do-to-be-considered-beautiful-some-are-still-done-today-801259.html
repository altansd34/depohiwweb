Or&nbsp;that you could wear <a href=# title=lipstick data-link=tag>lipstick</a> made from crushed ants and beetles? Or, better yet, that shaving the hair off the upper part of&nbsp;your forehead would make you look more noble or&nbsp;intelligent?<br>These and other practices were very common among women over the centuries. And some of&nbsp;them are still in&nbsp;use today, even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t realize&nbsp;it.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we&nbsp;picked out the strangest, craziest things that women have been subjected to&nbsp;just to&nbsp;meet <a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a>. One unfortunate tradition dates back to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt and is&nbsp;still going strong to&nbsp;this very day. We’ll let you draw your own conclusions on&nbsp;the matter!</p><p><h2>1. Red cosmetics made from beetles were very common in&nbsp;ancient times (and insects may still be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;some lipsticks today).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c13/813/ea66245ee1909cfc371c133c58.jpg><p align=left>To&nbsp;guarantee a&nbsp;beautiful and attractive pair of&nbsp;red-colored lips, Ancient Egyptian women would crush <a href=# title=insects data-link=tag>insects</a>. From that they would obtain a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;dye that they’d apply to&nbsp;their lips. This was <a href=# title=Cleopatra data-link=tag>Cleopatra</a>’s own method (pictured above, played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor" data-link=tag>Elizabeth Taylor</a> in&nbsp;the now-classic hit <a href=#>Cleopatra</a>). They also used a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;<a href=#>focus-algin</a>, iodine, and bromine mannite to&nbsp;make <a href=#>lip color</a>. However, little did some of&nbsp;them know that this combination could be&nbsp;fatal to&nbsp;the one who wore it&nbsp;as&nbsp;lipstick or&nbsp;to&nbsp;whoever kissed anyone wearing&nbsp;it.</p><p align=left>But if&nbsp;you think using bugs to&nbsp;make pigments is&nbsp;a&nbsp;thing of&nbsp;the past, you’d be&nbsp;wrong. Nowadays, a&nbsp;little bug that lives in&nbsp;different cacti in&nbsp;Mexico, in&nbsp;the southern part of&nbsp;the United States, and in&nbsp;Peru (the first producer and exporter of&nbsp;cochineal in&nbsp;the world), the <a href=#>Dactylopius coccus</a>, is&nbsp;used in&nbsp;the cosmetics, food, and beverage industries. This is&nbsp;actually what gives an&nbsp;intense red color to&nbsp;all these products. Therefore, it’s almost certain that you have either worn, drank, or&nbsp;eaten the dye extracted from this insect at&nbsp;some point in&nbsp;your life and maybe you didn’t even realize&nbsp;it!</p><p><h2>2. In&nbsp;Japan, having black teeth meant that you were beautiful, respected, mature, and loyal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/0dd/767f965293936858563033af9a.jpg><p align=left>Traces of&nbsp;blackened teeth can be&nbsp;seen on&nbsp;bones buried in&nbsp;Japan during the <a href=#>Kofun period</a> (250 to&nbsp;538 A.D.), between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Throughout <a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a>, this practice called <a href=#>ohaguro</a>, in&nbsp;Japan, had a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;different meanings depending on&nbsp;the time and place that it&nbsp;was used. For example, in&nbsp;some cases, it&nbsp;was meant to&nbsp;show that a&nbsp;woman had come of&nbsp;age, in&nbsp;some others, to&nbsp;indicate that she was married or&nbsp;to&nbsp;symbolize fidelity. It&nbsp;was also believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;preventing tooth decay. While a&nbsp;few historians claim that the painting was a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make married ladies look unattractive, there are many scholars that disagree with this theory.</p><p align=left>The ink or&nbsp;dye, called kanemizu, was prepared with iron filings diluted in&nbsp;vinegar, to&nbsp;which powdered <a href=#>gall</a> or&nbsp;tea was added. In&nbsp;the late 19th century, the Japanese government banned the practice of&nbsp;ohaguro, and today it&nbsp;is&nbsp;only used in&nbsp;plays, movies, and some traditional events. However, this tradition remains popular and is&nbsp;still practiced in&nbsp;some parts of&nbsp;Asia, including India, and also in&nbsp;Oceania.</p><p><h2>3. Japanese women discovered that nightingale feces could improve their skin (and this product is&nbsp;still used today!).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf7/867/aab19852fbb3bf72479d296fcf.jpg><p align=left>Since the 17th century, Japanese women have used a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;rice bran and the feces of&nbsp;a&nbsp;species of&nbsp;nightingale (called <a href=#>uguisu</a> in&nbsp;Japan) to&nbsp;lighten their skin. The habit was borrowed from Koreans, who were known to&nbsp;use bird droppings to&nbsp;remove difficult stains from their kimonos. <a href=#>Geishas</a> and <a href=#>kabuki</a> theater actors started using this exotic ingredient, called <a href=#>uguisu no&nbsp;fun</a>, to&nbsp;clean their skin after they removed their dense white <a href=# title=make-up data-link=tag>make-up</a>.</p><p align=left>You might find this story a&nbsp;bit silly, maybe even disgusting. But in&nbsp;any case, you should know that there’s actually some scientific reasoning to&nbsp;back up&nbsp;this practice. Bird droppings contain <a href=#>urea</a>, a&nbsp;powerful moisturizer, also present in&nbsp;human urine and sweat, which is&nbsp;widely used in&nbsp;the modern beauty products industry.</p><p align=left>But there’s more. The practice of&nbsp;using uguisu no&nbsp;fun as&nbsp;a&nbsp;moisturizer persists in&nbsp;the <a href=#>modern cosmetic industry</a>. However, nowadays, the feces are sterilized and 100% free of&nbsp;microorganisms. What a&nbsp;relief! You’ll be&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;know that, according to&nbsp;gossip magazines at&nbsp;least, <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=# title="Victoria Beckham" data-link=tag>Victoria Beckham</a> are some of&nbsp;the celebrities whose secret to&nbsp;looking amazing is&nbsp;nightingale droppings.</p><p><h2>4. Bad teeth were a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;status during the reign of&nbsp;Elizabeth I&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 16th century (as&nbsp;were white lead makeup and shaved eyebrows).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bee/e72/ca4c985cc2bdc1775c202d206f.jpg><p align=left>Queen Elizabeth I&nbsp;ruled England during the second half of&nbsp;the 16th century, and she was a&nbsp;major trendsetter. Of&nbsp;course, none of&nbsp;the trends she set are considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very attractive or&nbsp;healthy according to&nbsp;today’s standards. For starters, her teeth looked fairly worn and decayed because of&nbsp;her penchant for sweets.</p><p align=left>Cane sugar was a&nbsp;novelty in&nbsp;Europe at&nbsp;the time. It&nbsp;was brought from North Africa and was a&nbsp;very expensive product. So, having dark teeth was a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;status, and some women <a href=#>blackened</a> their smiles just to&nbsp;give the impression that they belonged to&nbsp;the upper classes.</p><p align=left>During this queen’s reign, having <a href=#>tanned skin</a> indicated that you belonged to&nbsp;the working class. That’s why wearing the super white makeup we’ve all seen in&nbsp;the movies was used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;distinguish the wealthy from the nobles. However, Queen Elizabeth I&nbsp;wore white makeup for another reason: she had been infected with the <a href=#>smallpox virus</a>, a&nbsp;disease that left deep scars on&nbsp;her face.</p><p align=left>The makeup that was used at&nbsp;the time is&nbsp;banned today because it&nbsp;was made with a&nbsp;base of&nbsp;lead, which can cause <a href=#>neurological </a>and other health problems. The typical look of&nbsp;the time was rounded off by&nbsp;shaving part of&nbsp;the hair so&nbsp;as&nbsp;to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big <a href=#>forehead</a>, a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;power and intelligence. This trend was also copied by&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the Queen’s subjects, men and women alike.</p><p><h2>5. European Renaissance noblewomen differed from others in&nbsp;that they wore incredibly high heels.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f03/eb4/a85d0b500b85e7233dcb92d39b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;15th and 16th century Italy, women belonging to&nbsp;the higher social classes strove to&nbsp;distinguish themselves from the rest by&nbsp;wearing very high shoes, called <a href=#>chopines</a>. There’s another explanation for the adoption of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;strange <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> trend: the platforms prevented the nobles’ dresses from dragging on&nbsp;the dirty streets and floors of&nbsp;the city as&nbsp;they strolled along.</p><p>The chopines’ trend emerged in&nbsp;Venice and quickly spread to&nbsp;other European countries, such as&nbsp;France and Spain. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;<a href=#>walk</a> with at&nbsp;least some degree of&nbsp;balance and stability, ladies who wore chopines were always accompanied by&nbsp;2&nbsp;servants to&nbsp;support them at&nbsp;shoulder-level, literally.</p><p><h2>6. Enormous wigs, fixed with lard, were a&nbsp;very elegant accessory in&nbsp;the 18th century (and mice loved them too!).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/174/7b4/4293a25f78958098af40815586.jpg><p align=left>In&nbsp;the French court of&nbsp;the 18th century there was a&nbsp;time when, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;look elegant, girls had to&nbsp;wear monumental wigs. They would have them decorated with all kinds of&nbsp;flowers, jewels, ribbons, and even stuffed birds. The image of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Princesse de&nbsp;Lamballe</a> (above), friend and confidant of&nbsp;Queen consort <a href=#>Marie Antoinette</a>, shows&nbsp;us a&nbsp;good example of&nbsp;what that trend looked like.</p><p align=left>These wigs were the masterpieces of&nbsp;skilled professionals who attached the fake hair to&nbsp;the real hair using <a href=#>animal lard</a>. Since women used to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with their wigs&nbsp;on, it&nbsp;was common for them to&nbsp;attract rats and other animals, especially while they were sleeping. Hence the origin of&nbsp;the <a href=#>expression</a> “Your hair looks like a&nbsp;rat’s nest.”</p><p><h2>7. In&nbsp;the 19th century, clothing and other objects were dyed with a&nbsp;pigment whose formula contained poison.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/52f/153/52032e5889834146c12b24355b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;19th century Europe, the term “fashion victim” had a&nbsp;literal meaning. A&nbsp;certain shade of&nbsp;green, called <a href=#>Paris green</a> or&nbsp;<a href=#>Scheele green</a>, became very popular to&nbsp;dye fabrics, ribbons, artificial flowers, hats, wallpaper, and other common objects that people used every day. However, this dye was made with arsenic, a&nbsp;highly toxic substance. Before the end of&nbsp;the century, several countries <a href=#>banned</a> its use in&nbsp;fashion and other manufacturing. In&nbsp;fact, today it’s used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pest control product.</p><p><h2>8. The expression “porcelain skin” had a&nbsp;literal meaning among wealthy women (they also imitated the Queen of&nbsp;England’s limp!).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ed/3ac/5d6e395516bcb3220c3ac498fa.png><p align=left>You may have heard your grandmother or&nbsp;some other older woman in&nbsp;the family comment that “so-and-so has porcelain skin.” Well, there was a&nbsp;time, in&nbsp;the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the expression had a&nbsp;literal meaning.</p><p align=left>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that <a href=#>Princess Alexandra of&nbsp;Denmark</a> (later known as&nbsp;Queen Consort of&nbsp;England) was an&nbsp;expert in&nbsp;the technique of&nbsp;<a href=#>enameling</a>, which basically involved applying a&nbsp;white paste made of&nbsp;zinc or&nbsp;lead (a&nbsp;toxic material) to&nbsp;the skin. They would then paint on&nbsp;the hardened paste to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they had pinkish faces, small veins, and other added details that made their makeup more realistic according to&nbsp;them. The result guaranteed a&nbsp;face without wrinkles and gave the impression of&nbsp;having “porcelain skin,” something for which Alexandra became famous.</p><p align=left>The effect could last for a&nbsp;long time, depending on&nbsp;the techniques used. Otherwise, it&nbsp;could also be&nbsp;refreshed from time to&nbsp;time. The same type of&nbsp;technique was used to&nbsp;apply makeup on&nbsp;the neck and arms. In&nbsp;specialized salons in&nbsp;New York, you could get enameling that lasted from 2&nbsp;days to&nbsp;6&nbsp;months.</p><p align=left>Another curious fact about Queen Alexandra: she suffered from rheumatic fever in&nbsp;1867, a&nbsp;condition that caused her to&nbsp;<a href=#>limp</a> for the rest of&nbsp;her life. During that period, English women began to&nbsp;imitate her lopsided steps. Some women even had shoes made with different heights to&nbsp;make their gait look more realistic.</p><p><h2>9. The chin reducer promised to&nbsp;restore lost youth in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few hours (today, this marketing technique still works).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffa/e4e/4f459a52929a2132ccb93bc9f5.jpg><p align=left>This 19th-century chin reducer, advertised by&nbsp;a&nbsp;New York merchant, looked more like an&nbsp;instrument of&nbsp;self-torture than anything else. And even if&nbsp;that was the case, it&nbsp;became extremely popular. It&nbsp;claimed to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the double chin and give women back “the freshness of&nbsp;youth.” This would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fun anecdote to&nbsp;tell at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party if&nbsp;this device was actually just a&nbsp;crazy invention of&nbsp;the past. Unfortunately, this just isn’t the case. There are modern versions of&nbsp;the chin reducer and they can be&nbsp;purchased from various online shopping sites (see the picture below).</p><p align=left>Could this possibly work? Pascale Day, a&nbsp;contributor to&nbsp;the English beauty website So&nbsp;Feminine, tested the product and answered that, indeed, the double chin is&nbsp;reduced when using this <a href=#>device</a>... But the effect only lasts a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days. “It&nbsp;isn’t made to&nbsp;last, it’s something you do&nbsp;to&nbsp;get ready before a&nbsp;night out,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/238/ebb/5bfe415bb4af45d850db1e45f0.jpg><p><h2>10. The latest fashion craze in&nbsp;the early 20th century: skirts that “bound” the legs and made it&nbsp;almost impossible to&nbsp;walk.</h2></p><p align=left>Tying and tightening: 2&nbsp;fundamental conditions for the women of&nbsp;yesteryear to&nbsp;feel beautiful and elegant when wearing a&nbsp;skirt. That might be&nbsp;why the <a href=#>hobble skirt</a> was a&nbsp;fashion trend that prevailed between 1908 and 1914. These skirts looked like a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;tube at&nbsp;the bottom and forced women to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take very short steps in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;walk. That might actually be&nbsp;where their <a href=#>name</a> comes from.</p><p>French designer <a href=#>Paul Poiret</a> claimed to&nbsp;have created this strange fashion trend. He&nbsp;even claimed to&nbsp;have been the one who made it&nbsp;popular in&nbsp;the United States. In&nbsp;New York and Los Angeles, for example, streetcars were adapted so&nbsp;that women could hop on&nbsp;wearing those “baby step skirts.” In&nbsp;the postcard below, a&nbsp;man can be&nbsp;seen laughing at&nbsp;this garment and making a&nbsp;joke: “It’s a&nbsp;skirt with a&nbsp;speed limit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/108/3ca/f5531b5c1c98e804206e04c843.jpg><p><h2>11. Ice mask to&nbsp;refresh your face, a&nbsp;hit in&nbsp;the ’30s in&nbsp;Hollywood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3d/d1f/ce4eb151fa9534e4e9a96056d8.jpg><p align=left>In&nbsp;the Hollywood of&nbsp;the 1930s and 1940s, parties were held daily at&nbsp;the mansions of&nbsp;big-name actors, directors, and producers. But no&nbsp;matter what happened, the day after, actresses had to&nbsp;look neat and beautiful. Their skin had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;radiant when shooting or&nbsp;taking part in&nbsp;press conferences.</p><p align=left>So, according to&nbsp;the <a href=#>advertising</a> of&nbsp;the time, this mask with plastic cubes filled with water could solve the problem of&nbsp;a&nbsp;swollen face. Just leave the mask in&nbsp;the freezer for a&nbsp;while, then put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;reduce puffiness. Max Factor, the company behind this “innovation,” claimed their masks could also come in&nbsp;handy when actresses needed to&nbsp;relieve their faces after a&nbsp;long scene. According to&nbsp;them, it&nbsp;would smooth their features and even protect them from the effects of&nbsp;the strong spotlights used in&nbsp;movie studios.</p><p><h2>12. During World War&nbsp;II, women painted their legs to&nbsp;create the illusion of&nbsp;wearing nylon stockings.</h2></p><p><a href=#>Nylon</a> stockings revolutionized fashion in&nbsp;1940, when 4&nbsp;million units arrived on&nbsp;the U.S. market and, incidentally, sold out in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few days. However, in&nbsp;1941, when the United States entered World War&nbsp;II, the entire production of&nbsp;this new synthetic fiber was destined for the manufacture of&nbsp;parachutes, ropes, nets, and other military artifacts.</p><p>Millions of&nbsp;women across the country were left without their precious accessory. But then the cosmetics industry tried to&nbsp;temporarily solve the problem by&nbsp;creating something called “<a href=#>liquid stockings</a>.” This new product made it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;apply makeup to&nbsp;the legs to&nbsp;give the impression that they were wearing nylon stockings. The more fanciful ladies used eyeliner to&nbsp;mimic the stitching of&nbsp;these stockings on&nbsp;the calves.</p><p><h2>13. Movie stars used to&nbsp;have their molars removed to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;more angular and photogenic face.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dbe/c46/b47a785699a3eb565e48dc63f9.jpg><p>This subject is&nbsp;controversial and has caused numerous debates among fans of&nbsp;classic American cinema. Hollywood stars of&nbsp;the 1940s, like Joan Crawford and Marlene Dietrich (see pictures above), reportedly had their back molars removed to&nbsp;give them a&nbsp;more “sunken” face and, therefore, more angular features.</p><p>Marlene always denied this rumor, even in&nbsp;her <a href=#>autobiography</a>. But she had another beauty trick: <a href=#>stretching</a> her facial skin with surgical tape hidden under her hair or&nbsp;wigs before going on&nbsp;stage.</p><p>As&nbsp;for Joan Crawford, this procedure was also nothing but a&nbsp;rumor. But later&nbsp;on, a&nbsp;specialist of&nbsp;her life and career, Bryan Johnson, presented <a href=#>documents</a> as&nbsp;proof that the star’s molars were extracted in&nbsp;1974 during a&nbsp;periodontal treatment, not in&nbsp;her youth. However, none of&nbsp;these are conclusive by&nbsp;any means.</p><p><h2>14. The standard of&nbsp;thinness caused many women to&nbsp;“flatten” their breasts to&nbsp;look slimmer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/976/8af/2a479c5587b9353dec5cb0875f.jpg><p align=left>Hiding your <a href=#>breasts</a> in&nbsp;any way you could was all the rage in&nbsp;the 1920s, when the standard of&nbsp;beauty dictated that women should have a&nbsp;<a href=#>super slim body</a>. <a href=#>Flapper girls</a>, as&nbsp;they were called back in&nbsp;the day, kept a&nbsp;thin silhouette thanks to&nbsp;special lingerie that compressed their breasts.</p><p align=left>After an&nbsp;era in&nbsp;which voluptuous and curvy women like Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, and Sophia Loren set the standard of&nbsp;beauty, the “straight” look became a&nbsp;new trend (again). This happened more or&nbsp;less during the second half of&nbsp;the 1960s. It&nbsp;was probably the popularity (and slenderness) of&nbsp;English model <a href=#>Twiggy</a> (pictured above) that led many girls to&nbsp;resort to&nbsp;bandages to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;imitate her slim figure and pull off the fashionable clothes from that time.</p><p>And you, have you ever done something crazy to&nbsp;look beautiful? Have you undergone an&nbsp;unusual treatment that worked for you? Or, on&nbsp;the contrary, did a&nbsp;procedure go&nbsp;wrong?
