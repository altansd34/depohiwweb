The spouses were together for 12 years and seemed to be quite happy, but broke up in 2011. The reason for the controversy was accusations of adultery.

According to one popular version, Rod was carried away by his secretary Angela Gordon. This woman was the main reason for the family's destruction. For a while, the relationship was kept in secret until Kate started to suspect infidelity. The actress unexpectedly came to her husband's office, even though she had earlier told him that she was going to a set in Lekki. Some sources claim that it was then that she received confirmation of her worst fears.</p><p class=align-left>The result was an official divorce, which occurred a few months later. People say that, after that, Angela settled in the flat of her lover and received a chic car from him. The audience did not immediately find out the reason for the separation because Kate was not in a hurry to give details to the media. In one of her interviews, where she was asked to say the real reason for the divorce, Kate Henshaw refused to open up about the break-up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c08c5e00c00a48c5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth love story until their split</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Celebrating actress Kate Henshaw’s 46th birthday with beautiful photos</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytdm76qpadfru.jpg><h2>Kate Henshaw relation to the situation</h2><p class=align-left>Kate refers to her former marriage philosophically, says that there were some great moments in it, for which she gives thanks.

She accepted this situation and decided to proudly move on with her life.</p><p class=align-left>The ambitious actress has many goals and dreams so there was simply not enough time to feel sorry for herself. The presence or absence of a husband does not affect what kind of person she is.
