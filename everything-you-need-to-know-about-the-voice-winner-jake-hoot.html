Instead, any singer that gets one chair turned for them could finish the season as the winner. Kelly Clarkson saw hoot as a winner as soon as he first took to the stage.</strong></p><p>Hoot was the last remaining country artist in The Voice season 17 finale. This singer was Kelly Clarkson’s third win since her time on the series began. Here’s everything you need to know about him, including the secret to his monumental win.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-he-was-part-of-team-kelly>1. He Was Part of Team Kelly</h2><p>Hoot first took to the stage singing “When it Rains it Pours” by Luke Combs. He joined Team Kelly after Clarkson was the only celebrity to turn their chair for him. Fans are still shocked that Blake Shelton didn’t turn his chair for this singer. He was saved by Clarkson in both the battle and knockout rounds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/q2YZdhGDJgo</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-the-voice-fans-predicted-his-win>2. The Voice Fans Predicted His Win</h2><p>Hoot became an obvious frontrunner during The Voice live playoffs. Fans knew that he was going into the finale when his music repeatedly became the most streamed on Apple Music. His studio singles from the Top 13, 11, 10, and eight received this honor. No one was surprised to see Hoot win since a big part of winning any talent show is getting maximum people to stream your songs.</p><p>He won the series because he consistently gave great performances. Hoot clearly had a leg up on the competition in that department; he was the most-streamed artist 4 weeks in a row and his songs hit No. 1 on both the Country and All Genres charts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Lc_pUHC9x/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-jake-hoot-was-the-only-country-artist-in-the-voice-finale>3. Jake Hoot Was The Only Country Artist in The Voice Finale</h2><p>The season 17 finale of The Voice was interesting in many aspects, including the fact that only one country artist remained. It also says a lot that the country artist wasn’t on Team Blake. This finale marked the first time since season 10 that each coach was represented in the finale. Going into the finale results, seven out of eight spots on the iTunes chart were occupied by The Voice Top 4. Even though the competition was pretty close, Hoot fans didn’t lose faith in the singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPCFLW9Bm-o/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-he-got-remarried-in-2021>4. He Got Remarried in 2021</h2><p>Hoot previously married emergency room nurse, Jessica Lynn Steele in 2013 and had their daughter <a href=#>Macy</a> in 2015. The couple divorced in 2017, this singer was a single father of one while competing on The Voice. Jake and Brittney Hoot met nearly 10 years ago as wedding singers. In 2018 Hoot went on a mission trip to Nicaragua where the two reconnected.</p><p>They once again reconnected in 2020 and have been together ever since. On March 7, 2021, he married his other half, Brittney Hoot. This adorable couple is seen singing together on his social media. They recently released a song together in the beginning of February.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-his-wife-is-expecting-their-first-child>5. His Wife is Expecting Their First Child</h2><p>On March 22, Hoot’s family shared a video announcing that they’re expecting. The video features Hoot playing guitar and singing. As the lyrics go on, his daughter and wife are seen holding up the lyrics to his song. The song concludes when Hoot sings “baby hoot coming soon.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbaIw7ruec0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-this-the-voice-winner-has-gone-viral-multiple-times-on-tiktok>6.

While he’s mostly seen singing on the video sharing app, he also posts some comedy content. Hoot has the most followers on this social media platform.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-he-found-his-musical-roots-in-the-dominican-republic>7. He Found His Musical Roots in The Dominican Republic</h2><p>Hoot was born in Texas but spent time living in the Dominican Republic during his youth while his parents were doing missionary work. While living in the Dominican Republic, Hoot learned to play the guitar and discovered his love for making music.</p><p>He moved back to the United States and went on to attend Tennessee Tech University. While he attended this college, he balanced music gigs and sports practices. He played for their football team at the time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3komLYhMaJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Masked-Singer-The-Chameleon-The-Crab-The-Piglet-The-Chameleon-The-Seashell-Bobby-Brown-Tamera-Mowry.jpeg alt="Celebrities Who Weren’t Known as Singers Before Competing on ‘The Masked Singer’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4yypq5lnpqypXnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnq3u8icnGavmaO7pr6Mo5iknV2dvLDAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-voice-winner-jake-hoot.html&text=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Jake%20Hoot&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-voice-winner-jake-hoot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-voice-winner-jake-hoot.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Jake%20Hoot" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-voice-winner-jake-hoot.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Jake%20Hoot" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-voice-winner-jake-hoot.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Jake%20Hoot" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-the-voice-winner-jake-hoot.html&description=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Jake%20Hoot" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./german-compound-nouns.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="German Compound Nouns Explained and Simplified">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1029897-meet-nigerian-surgeon-removed-baby-mothers-womb-operation-returned-photos-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dr. Oluyinka Olutoye, the brilliant Nigerian surgeon in Texas">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
