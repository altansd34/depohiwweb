As he began his career at Complex Magazine, he was made the host of <i>Hot Ones</i>, which is a show posted on the <i>First We Feast</i> YouTube channel.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jake DeVito biography: who is one of Danny Devito’s children?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <i>Hot Ones </i>Sean Evans show is prominent for hosting high profile celebrities, whereby during the interview session, the guest is served ten chicken wings spiced with hot sauce. After every piece of chicken wing, Sean asks the guest a set of questions.</p><p class=align-left>Each season of the show has new and different hot sauces. For example, in the fourth season of the show, a new sauce called <i>The Last Dab</i> was introduced. It is quite a unique sauce because it is made using Pepper X, which is rated at 3.18 million heat units.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, if a guest endures the hot sauce and completes the ten pieces, he or she gets the opportunity to promote their upcoming projects. Those who fail have their names added to the show’s<i> Hall of Shame</i>. Here is a list of some of the prominent personalities who have graced the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cafd06edbc29ae71.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Casey Frey biography: Who is the viral internet sensation?</span></p></a><ul><li>Shawn Mendes</li><li>Alton Brown</li><li>Terry Crews</li><li>Tyra Banks</li><li>Kevin Hart</li><li>Chris Jericho</li><li>Wiz Khalifa</li><li>Shaquille O’Neal</li></ul><p class=align-left>Sean Evans<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> <i>First We Feast </i></a>YouTube channel has over 8 million subscribers with approximately 510 videos posted since its inception.

However, the channel is estimated to generate approximately 8,500 US dollars per day, translating to 3 million US dollars per annum.</p><h2>Sean Evans net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Sean Evans has an approximate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of 40 million US dollars, and thus, he is a wealthy celebrity.

Currently, his Instagram account has approximately 394k followers, while his Twitter account has about 352k followers.</p><p class=align-left>Sean Evans is not an ordinary interviewer because of the uniqueness of his interviews.
