However, recently, the couple became the subject of&nbsp;online speculation when <a href=# title=it data-link=tag>it</a>&nbsp;seemed they might be&nbsp;discussing a&nbsp;“divorce” at&nbsp;the Golden Globes. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>CBS shared a&nbsp;video</strong></a> on&nbsp;their <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> page featuring John and Emily posing on&nbsp;the red carpet. In&nbsp;the brief clip, they appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happily smiling and quietly conversing, exhibiting typical married couple behavior. However, upon closer examination and attempted lip reading, certain fans began to&nbsp;suggest that <strong>John appeared to&nbsp;say, “I&nbsp;can’t wait for a&nbsp;divorce.”</strong></p><p><h2>So&nbsp;what exactly was John saying in&nbsp;this viral video?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/74c/5ad/0a359e53f6aea7e7f1579c5b9f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the comment section, fans began sharing their theories, with one user suggesting, “Did he&nbsp;say, ’I can’t wait to&nbsp;divorce?’ And she said, ’Hey,’ and he&nbsp;stated, ’I’m serious.’”</p><p>Others pointed out alternative interpretations, suggesting he&nbsp;might have said, “Get through this,” or&nbsp;commented on&nbsp;the chilly January weather, expressing excitement about “getting indoors” to&nbsp;Emily.</p><p>Following a&nbsp;year marked by&nbsp;numerous surprising celebrity breakups in&nbsp;2023, concerns quickly arose that John and Emily might be&nbsp;the next couple to&nbsp;consider parting ways. Speculation about the state of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> gained more momentum when <a href=# title="Emily Blunt" data-link=tag>Emily Blunt</a> attended the Governors Awards alone a&nbsp;day after the Golden Globes, further fueling persistent rumors.</p><p>However, it&nbsp;appears that this is&nbsp;not the situation, as&nbsp;an&nbsp;insider has stepped forward to&nbsp;assure everyone that the beloved couple is&nbsp;doing better than ever. According to&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anonymous source</a> quoted in&nbsp;Us&nbsp;Weekly, “There are no&nbsp;issues with Emily and John. <strong>They are absolutely not talking about divorce.</strong>” The insider also conveyed that Emily and John are currently brushing off the entire situation with laughter. “They think the rumors are funny and ridiculous,” the source <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>.</p><p>So, TikTok lip readers can take a&nbsp;day off; the case is&nbsp;closed for this particular Golden Globes conversation. Currently, neither John nor Emily has personally addressed the speculation, but Bright Side will be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;inform you if&nbsp;they choose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p><p><h2>Let’s dive into the story of&nbsp;their relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d1/110/ed43d45c88bc0e2295d990b089.jpg><p>After <a href=# title=dating data-link=tag>dating</a> Michael Bublé for 3&nbsp;years, Emily was finally able to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2008</a>. At&nbsp;the time, <a href=# title="John Krasinski" data-link=tag>John Krasinski</a> was not looking for love and was enjoying the single-man life. However, Emily had already won Krasinski’s heart even before they met, as&nbsp;the actor had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;her from the movie <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, which he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claims</a> to&nbsp;have watched over 70&nbsp;times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8df/46d/c2fc9b5dba81f19cc8dc86cd30.jpg><p>Nonetheless, John and Emily met in&nbsp;November 2008 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant. The actress recalled the moment: “We&nbsp;were discussing how much&nbsp;I was enjoying being single. And then my&nbsp;friend goes, ’Oh, my&nbsp;God, there’s my&nbsp;friend John.’ And that was&nbsp;it,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>The actor fell for Emily from the moment he&nbsp;saw her. He&nbsp;confessed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>: “I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;nervous. I&nbsp;was like, ‘Oh god,<strong> I&nbsp;think I’m going to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with her</strong>.”</p><p>That same year, Krasinski and Blunt had their first date. The actor remembers that day <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealing</a>: “I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;sure that&nbsp;I would never end up&nbsp;with her, I&nbsp;was like, ’You know what, I’m gonna blow it&nbsp;right away, and then that way you don’t feel bad.” To&nbsp;John’s delight, the date went well, and they’ve been dating ever since.</p><p><h2>John casually proposed to&nbsp;Emily in&nbsp;2009</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c1/04a/2919b95ccc9d240a62880f12fe.jpg><p>It&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;love at&nbsp;first sight for both of&nbsp;them, since Krasinski and Blunt got engaged in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>August 2009</a>, after dating for less than a&nbsp;year. A&nbsp;month after the proposal, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recounted</a> their engagement, which featured a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;tears.</p><p>“She did cry after I&nbsp;cried, and we&nbsp;cried and then everyone around&nbsp;us was crying,” he&nbsp;said. “Then, I&nbsp;think people weren’t really sure what was going&nbsp;on, but they were crying because we&nbsp;were crying. But it&nbsp;was great. <strong>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, she said yes</strong>, which is&nbsp;great. It’s a&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;this whole thing.”</p><p><h2>The 2&nbsp;lovebirds got married in&nbsp;Italy</h2></p><p>On&nbsp;July&nbsp;10, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2010</a>, over a&nbsp;year after proposing and becoming engaged, John and Emily married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small outdoor ceremony on&nbsp;George Clooney’s property near Lake Como, Italy. Later, at&nbsp;the 2010 Emmy Awards, the newlywed couple attended one of&nbsp;their first red-carpet events as&nbsp;husband and wife (see picture above).</p><p>The flame of&nbsp;their love was still burning after nearly 3&nbsp;years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, and the couple has spoken out about their devotion on&nbsp;numerous occasions. When questioned about marriage life, Emily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that meeting John had completely changed her life. “When I&nbsp;feel the support that&nbsp;I have from him, <strong>I&nbsp;feel invincible</strong>. There’s someone behind you on&nbsp;your good days and someone in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you on&nbsp;your bad days.”</p><p><h2>Krasinski and Blunt welcomed their first child</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbd/289/dbb8e5531581f84d3866734138.jpg><p>Emily and John welcomed their first child, Hazel Krasinski, in&nbsp;February <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2014</a>. They broke the news through a&nbsp;tweet from Krasinski’s account, informing their friends and followers that Hazel Krasinski had come into the world.</p><p>“Wanted to&nbsp;let the news out directly,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>. “<strong>Emily and&nbsp;I are so&nbsp;incredibly happy to&nbsp;welcome our daughter Hazel</strong> into the world today! Happy bday!”</p><p><h2>The family expands with the birth of&nbsp;their second kid</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c26/795/26bc9159629866bb0ec39e72aa.jpg><p>Over 2&nbsp;years after welcoming their first child, the couple announced Emily’s pregnancy, and subsequently, during an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> about the film <i>13&nbsp;Hours</i>, John praised his wife and their significant life. “<strong>The best days of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life started when&nbsp;I met my&nbsp;wife</strong>. She’s one of&nbsp;the coolest people, she’s so&nbsp;talented, she’s beautiful, and she’s certainly out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;league.”</p><p>In&nbsp;June <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2016</a>, the Krasinski-Blunt family welcomed their second child, named Violet, with John announcing the news on&nbsp;Twitter once more. “What better way to&nbsp;celebrate the 4th than to&nbsp;announce our 4th family member!!! 2&nbsp;weeks ago we&nbsp;met our beautiful daughter Violet,” Krasinski <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p><h2>The couple’s first movie partnership</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/955/75b/f04b5d582298c66096c0a7adfa.jpg><p>Even though they work in&nbsp;the same industry, Emily and John have never partnered on&nbsp;a&nbsp;film. However, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2017</a>, John announced the news on&nbsp;Instagram with a&nbsp;sweetly effusive post about how much he&nbsp;had yearned to&nbsp;work with his wife. They were cast as&nbsp;married parents in&nbsp;<i>A&nbsp;Quiet Place</i>, which premiered in&nbsp;August 2018, and Krasinski wrote and directed the film. Working together, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;the couple, has <strong>brought them even closer</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d83/204/7d1d1b5720bf2a620ae506a25c.jpg><p>Emily was awarded for her work in&nbsp;the film, and her heartfelt acceptance speech was not without admiration for her husband and co-star. “I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;share this completely with my&nbsp;husband, John Krasinski because the entire experience of&nbsp;doing this with you has completely pierced my&nbsp;heart directly,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “You are a&nbsp;stunning filmmaker. <strong>I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with you</strong> and to&nbsp;have done this film with you”.</p><p><h2>11&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2eb/97a/fb009e505f90ebc2d7d2e69c25.jpg><p>“Having John’s support is&nbsp;everything because <strong>we&nbsp;are each other’s confidants</strong>.
