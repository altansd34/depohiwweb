But there are some lucky few that get a&nbsp;second chance to&nbsp;shine. That’s exactly what happened to&nbsp;Mayim Bialik&nbsp;— she started her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> with a&nbsp;starring role when she was very young, retired many years later, then came back to&nbsp;acting. Although you could say that she is&nbsp;very lucky, she’s actually much more than that. Bialik has worked all her life and has fought against many obstacles in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;fulfill her dreams.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> reviewed some of&nbsp;the most important moments of&nbsp;her career so&nbsp;that they can serve as&nbsp;inspiration for those who, like her, want to&nbsp;see their wishes come true.</p><p>Bialik was born in&nbsp;1975 in&nbsp;San Diego, California, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;Jewish immigrants.&nbsp;3&nbsp;of&nbsp;her grandparents had emigrated from the old continent and raised the entire family in&nbsp;their traditions. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a>, “My&nbsp;parents were first-generation Americans, so&nbsp;they had a&nbsp;very strict immigrant mentality.”</p><p>Even though she started working on&nbsp;<a href=# title=TV data-link=tag>TV</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra and in&nbsp;minor roles, her parents never <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>treated</a> her differently. “They treated me&nbsp;like a&nbsp;normal girl who had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school, do&nbsp;her homework, and wait for my&nbsp;brother to&nbsp;come get&nbsp;me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c15/0ef/e3b45256be99aeb56cd6a8d1ae.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;11, after working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra periodically, she managed to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;2&nbsp;films, <i>Pumpkinhead</i> and <i>Beaches</i>. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, she revealed, “I&nbsp;don’t consider myself a&nbsp;child actress because&nbsp;I started acting almost in&nbsp;high school. Most child actors started when they were little. They have different expectations. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;different perspective.”</p><p>Soon after at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;14, she got her first break as&nbsp;a&nbsp;leading actress in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, <i>Blossom</i>, a&nbsp;show ahead of&nbsp;its time. “It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;anomaly in&nbsp;1990. It&nbsp;was about a&nbsp;young girl who was unconventional, quirky, smart, funny, and spunky. Our show touched on&nbsp;issues that were very controversial at&nbsp;those times,” Bialik said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3e4/a31/a2e5ac5eb0887ddf8ae2dd2e14.png><p>Bialik <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that despite being really famous during the time the series was airing&nbsp;— she started there when she was only 14&nbsp;and stayed until she turned&nbsp;19, and she always kept things in&nbsp;balance thanks to&nbsp;the support of&nbsp;her family. “Everything was very serious on&nbsp;the set, and that is&nbsp;very important,” Bialik said.</p><p>After 5&nbsp;seasons were released from 1991 to&nbsp;1995, <i>Blossom</i> came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end. In&nbsp;the last episode, her character said goodbye to&nbsp;the series with these <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>words</a>: “Life is&nbsp;not made of&nbsp;poetry, or&nbsp;songs, or&nbsp;dreams, but real things... Here’s the advice: try to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;by&nbsp;the handle.”</p><p>While filming <i>Blossom</i>, one of&nbsp;her mentors instilled in&nbsp;her a&nbsp;love of&nbsp;<a href=# title=science data-link=tag>science</a>. “I&nbsp;thought science was hard, and&nbsp;I assumed there was something in&nbsp;me&nbsp;that wasn’t for that. She showed me&nbsp;that science is&nbsp;for women, it’s exciting, and you can fall in&nbsp;love with science like you can fall in&nbsp;love with literature or&nbsp;art... And I&nbsp;began to&nbsp;see myself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;scientist,” Bialik said in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>.</p><p>So&nbsp;then, when the series was over in&nbsp;1995, she enrolled at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;California with the intention of&nbsp;leaving acting behind and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>becoming</a> a&nbsp;scientist or&nbsp;professor: “I&nbsp;made the decision to&nbsp;leave acting because&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;neuroscience. I&nbsp;had other interests. I&nbsp;think women should be&nbsp;encouraged to&nbsp;try many things, especially with the underrepresentation of&nbsp;women in&nbsp;science. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;12&nbsp;years, I&nbsp;had 2&nbsp;children, and that became my&nbsp;main life’s work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37c/6bb/a87be35898ab0e15b5fe6ec342.png><p>After earning her PhD in&nbsp;neuroscience in&nbsp;2007, Bialik’s plan was to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;academia, but that changed after she became a&nbsp;mother of&nbsp;2&nbsp;beautiful boys, Miles and Frederick. She fell in&nbsp;love with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attachment parenting</a>, but understood that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;lifestyle not compatible with academic life. So&nbsp;for the second time in&nbsp;her life, she decided to&nbsp;change careers. “Putting the kids in&nbsp;daycare or&nbsp;moving away from them...the latter played a&nbsp;big part in&nbsp;the decision,” she reflected in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/726/c43/4113795999832bbbc517cd08e5.png><p>In&nbsp;2005, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>returned</a> to&nbsp;acting with the comedy film, <i>Kalamazoo</i>, and she also appeared in&nbsp;several&nbsp;TV series, such as&nbsp;<i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, <i>Fat Actress</i>, and <i>7th Heaven</i>. When asked about this, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;love being on&nbsp;the set, I&nbsp;love watching all the cameras and the lights. I&nbsp;love watching everything come together. I’m a&nbsp;really old-fashioned actor. I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the set.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cba/ae8/69712e5ccf87bdcf45494b77fe.jpg><p>Then in&nbsp;2010, when she appeared in&nbsp;the last episode of&nbsp;the third season of&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, fame came knocking back at&nbsp;her door. In&nbsp;season&nbsp;4, she got a&nbsp;recurring role and became an&nbsp;audience favorite. But it&nbsp;was more than just the joy of&nbsp;being in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the cameras that drew her back to&nbsp;acting.</p><p>“The truth is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I was running out of&nbsp;health insurance and&nbsp;I realized that if&nbsp;I could get a&nbsp;few jobs here and there, it&nbsp;was enough to&nbsp;have the Actors’ Association insurance. I&nbsp;didn’t expect to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-time actress, but <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> drew me&nbsp;in,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a14/813/538cd859dd9a193a91ca8dbf2b.png><p>The year 2010 was an&nbsp;intense one for Bialik. She released her first book,<i> Beyond the Sling: A&nbsp;Real-Life Guide to&nbsp;Raising Confident, Loving Children the Attachment Parenting Way</i>, where she looks back at&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the key moments of&nbsp;her life, like leaving college and devoting herself completely to&nbsp;raising her children in&nbsp;this way. Over the years, she has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>edited</a> several other books on&nbsp;this topic, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;books on&nbsp;vegan food and nutritional juicing.</p><p>After the end of&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, in&nbsp;2019, Bialik took a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years off to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;her personal projects. Still, she made sporadic appearances on&nbsp;different quiz shows. In&nbsp;2021, she was offered a&nbsp;lead role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;series by&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;<i>Call Me&nbsp;Kat</i>.</p><p>“Jim Parsons (Sheldon on&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i>) brought me&nbsp;this project he&nbsp;had with his company. He&nbsp;said to&nbsp;me, ’If anyone can look adorable and be&nbsp;a&nbsp;little bit annoying, it’s you!’ For a&nbsp;45-year-old woman, I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;say my&nbsp;days are numbered, but&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;capitalize on&nbsp;the moments when people want to&nbsp;see you and live comedy with you,” Bialik <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview. The series was renewed for its second season and premiered in&nbsp;January 2022.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;her own series, Bialik has started to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more open about her mental health. Last year, she hosted a&nbsp;podcast where she interviewed celebrities about the importance of&nbsp;being healthy. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “My&nbsp;family history includes depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic.... I&nbsp;have sought out support groups that were very helpful to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;family.”</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;her experience, she now <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seeks</a> to&nbsp;help others like her. “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;inform and raise awareness to&nbsp;make the world of&nbsp;mental health smaller and smaller. When people speak out, it’s very important that they fight against these illnesses.” Her help is&nbsp;not limited to&nbsp;opening the conversation about this topic. In&nbsp;her special appearance on&nbsp;<i>Jeopardy!</i> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;host, she did so&nbsp;on&nbsp;behalf of&nbsp;NAMI (National Alliance on&nbsp;Mental Illness), raising a&nbsp;large donation and being able to&nbsp;talk about mental illness on&nbsp;a&nbsp;national level.</p><p>Mayim Bialik continues to&nbsp;impress thanks to&nbsp;her energetic and optimistic personality. In&nbsp;2019, she started writing a&nbsp;screenplay for a&nbsp;movie, called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>As&nbsp;They Made Us</i></a>. Although it&nbsp;was delayed several times, the movie was filmed in&nbsp;2021 and was released in&nbsp;April 2022. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family drama starring Dustin Hoffman, Simon Helberg (her co-star on&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i>), Candice Bergen, and Dianna Agron.</p><p>Bialik isn’t afraid to&nbsp;start over, she’s already done it&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times in&nbsp;her life&nbsp;— first giving up&nbsp;stardom, then her academic life for the sake of&nbsp;her kids. Now, she continues to&nbsp;use her new career momentum to&nbsp;generate outreach and dialogue about mental health. With all this work, she proves that it’s never too late to&nbsp;start over as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you do&nbsp;what you love and do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for the people you love the most, starting with yourself.</p><p>What other life stories have inspired you?
