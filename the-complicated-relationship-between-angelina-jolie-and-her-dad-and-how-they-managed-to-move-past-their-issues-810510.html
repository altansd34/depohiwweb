The pair had many disagreements in&nbsp;the past, which even led them to&nbsp;have zero contact for several years. But after the actress’s mom passed away, she slowly started reconnecting with her dad. Through a&nbsp;shared passion for film and Jolie’s kids’ help, the 2&nbsp;have successfully mended their relationship and are beginning a&nbsp;new chapter.</p><p><h2>Angelina Jolie’s parents separated when she was a&nbsp;toddler.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b6/107/8cca125642b20ddd8e5e13d72a.jpg><p>Anthony Taafe/Colema/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Anthony Taafe/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS</p><p>Angelina Jolie’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>parents</a>, John Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, were married for 9&nbsp;years and had 2&nbsp;children together. They both made their mark on&nbsp;the acting world&nbsp;— Voight was even awarded an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oscar</a> in&nbsp;1979 for his role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Coming Home</i></a>. Voight and Bertrand got <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> in&nbsp;1980 when Jolie was still a&nbsp;small child.</p><p><h2>Voight wasn’t the ideal husband, and he&nbsp;admitted to&nbsp;having an&nbsp;affair.</h2></p><p>There were many speculations about what led to&nbsp;Voight and Bertrand’s divorce, but recently Jolie’s dad admitted to&nbsp;infidelity, explaining, “I&nbsp;had an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>affair</a> and there was a&nbsp;divorce. There was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;hurt and anger.”</p><p>Jolie also talked about her parents’ divorce as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the reasons why she had a&nbsp;difficult relationship with her father. “<strong>When my&nbsp;father had an&nbsp;affair, it&nbsp;changed her life.</strong> It&nbsp;set her dream of&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> life ablaze. But she still loved being a&nbsp;mother,” Jolie said about her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mom</a>.</p><p><h2>Despite her parents’ messy separation, Jolie was a&nbsp;daddy’s girl for many years.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;seems like both Voight and Jolie’s problems built up&nbsp;over the years because at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the actress’s career, her dad was often there to&nbsp;support her. In&nbsp;the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lookin’ to&nbsp;Get Out</i></a>, Jolie got her first movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a>, which happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alongside her father, when she was only 7&nbsp;years old<i>. </i>In&nbsp;2001, they were co-stars once again in&nbsp;the successful adventure film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</i></a>.</p><p>When Angelina Jolie won an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;2000, she also praised her dad in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acceptance speech</a>, saying, “<strong>Dad, you’re a&nbsp;great actor, but you’re a&nbsp;better father</strong>.” Years later, she recalled Voight’s reaction: “He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that that was one of&nbsp;the biggest compliments somebody could give him, that it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great father. And&nbsp;so, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;exceptional night for everybody in&nbsp;my&nbsp;family.”</p><p><h2>After Jolie’s divorce from Billy Bob Thornton, the father-daughter duo became estranged.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/742/fcb/18db28533088c4242a94a84f85.jpg><p>Jolie’s marriage with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second husband</a> ended in&nbsp;2003, and around that time, her relationship with Voight soured too. Voight said some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hurtful</a> things about his daughter, while Jolie preferred to&nbsp;keep their problems out of&nbsp;the spotlight. However, she said, “After all these years, I&nbsp;have determined that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not healthy for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around my&nbsp;father.”</p><p><h2>They had zero contact for 5&nbsp;years.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23b/065/9cb26b5c9eba80d6f33bb81862.jpg><p>The father-daughter duo’s falling out led them to&nbsp;not speak to&nbsp;each other for several years. In&nbsp;the same year, Jolie filed for divorce, and she also legally dropped her father’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surname</a>. “<strong>My&nbsp;father and&nbsp;I don’t speak</strong>,” Jolie revealed in&nbsp;2004. Jolie and Voight would only break their silence in&nbsp;2007 when the actress’s mom, Bertrand, unfortunately, passed away.</p><p><h2>They began reaching out to&nbsp;each other in&nbsp;the past decade.</h2></p><p>After her mom’s death, Jolie briefly informed Voight about her passing. The actress had a&nbsp;very close relationship with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mom</a>, saying, “If&nbsp;anybody ever tells me&nbsp;that I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;them like my&nbsp;mom was to&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great compliment.” But the brief phone call made by&nbsp;Jolie didn’t yet mean that she and Voight were back on&nbsp;speaking terms.</p><p>“<strong>I’m always trying to&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>reach</strong></a><strong> her and send her my&nbsp;love</strong>,” Voight said in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2008&nbsp;interview. And in&nbsp;the same year, they also talked to&nbsp;each other on&nbsp;Christmas day. “We&nbsp;have spoken, and we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know each other and maybe try not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;this daddy and daughter, but to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for each other as&nbsp;friends in&nbsp;the coming years,” Jolie said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;describe the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reconciliation</a>.</p><p><h2>Angelina Jolie’s kids brought her closer to&nbsp;her dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/618/78c/b7e41d52f4b5fd488211e9080c.jpg><p>Gilbert Flores/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News</p><p>Over the past decade, Voight and Jolie have slowly started warming up&nbsp;to&nbsp;each other again, and they were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reportedly</a> seen together several times. Jolie’s divorce proceedings from Brad Pitt have also brought them closer together, and so&nbsp;did Voight’s grandchildren. “<strong>He’s been very good at&nbsp;understanding they needed their grandfather at&nbsp;this time</strong>,” the actress said about her famous dad.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;podcast, Jolie gave additional details about their reconciliation, revealing, “<strong>Jon and&nbsp;I have gotten to&nbsp;know each other&nbsp;— through grandchildren now. We’re finding a&nbsp;new relationship</strong>.” In&nbsp;recent years, Voight had only good things to&nbsp;say about his daughter, praising her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talent</a>. “She’s very strong. And that persona is&nbsp;very rare. <strong>When you see Angelina, you know what’s coming, you know who she&nbsp;is. She’s like one of&nbsp;those people like [Humphrey] Bogart or&nbsp;Katharine Hepburn</strong>.”</p><p>Angelina Jolie’s heartwarming decision to&nbsp;adopt Maddox from a&nbsp;Cambodian orphanage in&nbsp;2002 marked the beginning of&nbsp;her <a href=#>beautiful blended family</a>. Despite initial challenges due to&nbsp;Cambodia’s baby trafficking issues, Jolie’s bond with Maddox grew, leading her to&nbsp;further embrace Cambodian culture and history. Maddox’s influence even extended to&nbsp;Jolie’s directorial choices, as&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;her film “First They Killed My&nbsp;Father,” which delves into Cambodia’s past.</p><p>Angelina Jolie’s <a href=#>humanitarian spirit</a> shines through her two-decade-long commitment to&nbsp;aiding refugees, fighting poverty, and conserving nature. Her journey began in&nbsp;Cambodia during the filming of&nbsp;“Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,” which ignited her passion for global causes. From purchasing land to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;wildlife reservation to&nbsp;supporting numerous foundations, Jolie’s philanthropic endeavors span various sectors. Notably, her advocacy for women’s rights and health awareness has made significant impacts, inspiring many, including her own children, to&nbsp;give back.</p><p>Recently, Angelina Jolie candidly discussed the pressures of&nbsp;conforming to&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood’s beauty standards</a>, referencing her portrayal as&nbsp;Lara Croft. Despite rigorous training for the role, Jolie was taken aback by&nbsp;the edited film posters that removed her nipples, highlighting the industry’s unrealistic expectations. Embracing her unique features, Jolie champions body positivity, urging for a&nbsp;more inclusive representation of&nbsp;women in&nbsp;media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYycpqaonJ6wosDEnWSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdl7K1w8SepWaZnpyyrbXNmmSjp5yesm6tzZ1koZ2iYrGisIyapZ1lmKTEbsDHnrBmpZGjrqixw2arqGWdpMOmec%2Baqq1lpJ2yqr6MoqqsrZWoenl9j25oaWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-complicated-relationship-between-angelina-jolie-and-her-dad-and-how-they-managed-to-move-past-their-issues-810510.html&text=The%20Inspiring%20Story%20of%20How%20Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20Her%20Father%20Found%20Common%20Ground%20After%20Years%20of%20Estrange&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-complicated-relationship-between-angelina-jolie-and-her-dad-and-how-they-managed-to-move-past-their-issues-810510.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-complicated-relationship-between-angelina-jolie-and-her-dad-and-how-they-managed-to-move-past-their-issues-810510.html&title=The%20Inspiring%20Story%20of%20How%20Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20Her%20Father%20Found%20Common%20Ground%20After%20Years%20of%20Estrange" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-complicated-relationship-between-angelina-jolie-and-her-dad-and-how-they-managed-to-move-past-their-issues-810510.html&title=The%20Inspiring%20Story%20of%20How%20Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20Her%20Father%20Found%20Common%20Ground%20After%20Years%20of%20Estrange" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-complicated-relationship-between-angelina-jolie-and-her-dad-and-how-they-managed-to-move-past-their-issues-810510.html&title=The%20Inspiring%20Story%20of%20How%20Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20Her%20Father%20Found%20Common%20Ground%20After%20Years%20of%20Estrange" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-complicated-relationship-between-angelina-jolie-and-her-dad-and-how-they-managed-to-move-past-their-issues-810510.html&description=The%20Inspiring%20Story%20of%20How%20Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20Her%20Father%20Found%20Common%20Ground%20After%20Years%20of%20Estrange" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-cruise-reportedly-wants-to-rekindle-romance-with-sofia-vergara.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Cruise Reportedly Wants to Rekindle Romance with Sofia Vergara">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-5-most-romantic-talent-show-performances-ever.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 5 Most Romantic Talent Show Performances Ever">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
