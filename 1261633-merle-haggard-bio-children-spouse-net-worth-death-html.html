Despite having a rough start in life, he transformed his behaviour and became one of the country's top country songwriters, singers, fiddlers, and guitarists.</p><h3>Where was Merle Haggard from?</h3><p class=align-left>Merle Haggard was born on 6 April 1937 in Oildale, California, United States of America. The family had relocated from Checotah, Oklahoma, to California following the torching down of their barn in 1934. The fire occurred during the Great Depression.</p><h3>Who are Merle Haggard's parents</h3><p class=align-left>His father's name was James Francis Haggard, while his mother's was Flossie Mae Harp. Both his parents were of Scottish ancestry.</p><p class=align-left>After moving to California, his father secured a job at the Santa Fe Railroad.
