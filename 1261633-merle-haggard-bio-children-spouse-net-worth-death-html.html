The family had relocated from Checotah, Oklahoma, to California following the torching down of their barn in 1934. The fire occurred during the Great Depression.</p><h3>Who are Merle Haggard's parents</h3><p class=align-left>His father's name was James Francis Haggard, while his mother's was Flossie Mae Harp. Both his parents were of Scottish ancestry.</p><p class=align-left>After moving to California, his father secured a job at the Santa Fe Railroad.
