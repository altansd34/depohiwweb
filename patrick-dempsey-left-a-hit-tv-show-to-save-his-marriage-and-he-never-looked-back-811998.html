What people didn’t know at&nbsp;the time was that Patrick had made this decision out of&nbsp;love. His work took up&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge <a href=# title=part data-link=tag>part</a> of&nbsp;his life, and the only way to&nbsp;get back his wife, Jillian Fink, was to&nbsp;sort out his priorities and put his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> first. Patrick and Jillian patched things&nbsp;up, called off their split, and, 23&nbsp;years later, are still together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2b/de5/a8a84650178f2f2e1e523f8258.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1994, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Patrick Dempsey</a> made an&nbsp;appointment at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Los Angeles beauty salon called Delux. The salon’s stylist and owner, Jillian Fink, thought it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;joke, as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the employees was a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;prankster. “All the people he&nbsp;had written in&nbsp;were names of&nbsp;<a href=#>celebrities</a> famous in&nbsp;the ’80s, like Molly Ringwald,” Fink <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recounted</a>.</p><p>The actor was 28&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time and had already achieved a&nbsp;certain amount of&nbsp;popularity, due to&nbsp;his roles in&nbsp;<i>Can’t Buy Me&nbsp;Love</i> and <i>Loverboy</i>, among other titles.</p><p>When the actor opened the door, the stylist couldn’t believe&nbsp;it. “I&nbsp;was shocked. But at&nbsp;the same time, I&nbsp;was happy because he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;cute,” Jillian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> years later. The situation was complex, to&nbsp;say the least, as&nbsp;she was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>, and he&nbsp;was ending his first <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;Rocky Parker, an&nbsp;<a href=#>actress</a> 26&nbsp;years his senior.</p><p>Dempsey could have gone that one time and never come back, but he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;visit the salon for a&nbsp;long time. By&nbsp;his own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admission</a>, “It&nbsp;took another three years of&nbsp;occasional haircuts and harmless banter.” But he&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;certain connection as&nbsp;many years later he&nbsp;said that “she was always <a href=#>flirting</a>,” which Jillian claimed was a&nbsp;lie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/157/9f4/122fbf576aa25bde6d200ac123.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1997, after Patrick’s divorce, one of&nbsp;his friends told the actor that Jillian had separated, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;call her. The first <a href=#>date</a> seemed as&nbsp;if&nbsp;taken out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;romcom&nbsp;— the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cooked</a> pasta for her at&nbsp;his house. Their love was so&nbsp;dizzying and overwhelming that within three months they were living together, and two years later, in&nbsp;1999, they got married.</p><p>The couple had an&nbsp;intimate ceremony on&nbsp;a&nbsp;farm in&nbsp;Maine, which belonged to&nbsp;the actor’s family. “He&nbsp;saw her and started crying,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> Kristen Mason, the bride’s sister and business partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ae/709/af8a5f530e82da361151a51700.jpg><p>After they tied the knot, both of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=careers data-link=tag>careers</a> took off. Jillian, who had sold her Delux salon in&nbsp;1998, began making her own <a href=#>cosmetics</a>. She took a&nbsp;major leap forward when she created a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lipstick</a> for the filming of&nbsp;<i>Charlie’s Angels</i> in&nbsp;2000, motivated by&nbsp;her friend <a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a>.</p><p>As&nbsp;for Patrick, who had been going through a&nbsp;slump in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;work and popularity for a&nbsp;few years, he&nbsp;rebounded in&nbsp;2000 with the role of&nbsp;detective Mark Kincaid in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scream&nbsp;3</i></a>, a&nbsp;film from the popular horror franchise.</p><p>With both of&nbsp;their careers flourishing, she in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=cosmetics data-link=tag>cosmetics</a> industry and he&nbsp;in&nbsp;the film industry, they decided to&nbsp;enlarge their family. In&nbsp;2002, they welcomed Talula, their eldest daughter, and in&nbsp;2007, their twins Sullivan and Darby. Patrick spoke about his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;father a&nbsp;few years ago, “I’m constantly amazed by&nbsp;their insight and their observations. It’s fascinating and fun to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with answers to&nbsp;their questions.”</p><p>Despite their strong bond, the couple started experiencing some issues over the years. Dempsey seemed to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;devote to&nbsp;his family. In&nbsp;2004, the actor started racing cars professionally and, in&nbsp;parallel, continued with his acting career, being one of&nbsp;the main stars of&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ede/011/547a5f5b8ea433a8fa966484e7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2015, Dempsey was in&nbsp;Daytona Beach for a&nbsp;24-hour race when Jillian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filed for divorce</a>. At&nbsp;the time, their oldest daughter was&nbsp;12, and their twins were about to&nbsp;turn 8. “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;with careful consideration and mutual respect that we&nbsp;have decided to&nbsp;end our marriage,” the couple’s official <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statement</a> read.</p><p>In&nbsp;the months following the announcement, despite the rumors, they attended couples counseling to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pick up&nbsp;the pieces</a> of&nbsp;their relationship. “Jill and&nbsp;I decided it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;our issues and improve. We&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;role models for our kids like, okay, if&nbsp;you have differences, you can work them out.” In&nbsp;2016, they called off the divorce and got back together.</p><p>The actor had to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;radical decision to&nbsp;win his wife back. In&nbsp;2015, he&nbsp;left his role as&nbsp;Derek Shepherd in&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, which left thousands of&nbsp;fans heartbroken. In&nbsp;addition, he&nbsp;stopped racing cars and only kept his position as&nbsp;owner of&nbsp;the racing team.</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;therapy, Dempsey understood that his family should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;priority and that quality time with his wife and children <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was very important</a>. “I&nbsp;became frustrated with the lack of&nbsp;quality of&nbsp;experience in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;that deeper level and not just skirt the surface.”</p><p>They finally reconciled but never stopped <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>working on&nbsp;their relationship</a>. “You’ve got to&nbsp;communicate, stay open, and not get lazy,” said the actor, who decided to&nbsp;open his heart and speak about what keeps his marriage strong. He&nbsp;even stressed the importance of&nbsp;going on&nbsp;dates, despite the difficulty of&nbsp;raising three children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2a/32f/0ca51f5b2bb4529683c4476c32.jpg><p>Since then, Jillian and Patrick dedicate romantic posts to&nbsp;each other now and then, either for their birthdays or&nbsp;for their anniversary. A&nbsp;very beautiful one was shared in&nbsp;August 2018, when they took a&nbsp;photo kissing each other in&nbsp;the same place where they got married&nbsp;— the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>message read</a>, “This spot 19&nbsp;years ago, today.”</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;phrase that goes, “insist, persist, resist, and never desist,” and this couple stands by&nbsp;it. Believing that relationships are perfect all the time is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mistake. Fame and money can make&nbsp;us think that celebrities live in&nbsp;rosy worlds, but this is&nbsp;not the case, and the story of&nbsp;the Dempsey-Fink family proves&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ec/5f5/b5191459ba9accd1000c684a37.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are passionate about celebrity love stories, and we&nbsp;believe you probably feel the same way.
