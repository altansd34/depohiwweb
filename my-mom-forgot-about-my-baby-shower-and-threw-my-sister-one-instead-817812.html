I&nbsp;(30F) own two small businesses with my&nbsp;husband, and we&nbsp;work hard, long hours. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;miscarriage last year and were overjoyed to&nbsp;find out we&nbsp;were pregnant again. My&nbsp;parents were so&nbsp;excited and were way more loving and attentive than they’ve ever been. That&nbsp;is, until my&nbsp;sister announced she was also pregnant. With twins.</p><p>I&nbsp;have been supportive of&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister but was secretly devastated we’d be&nbsp;pregnant at&nbsp;the same time because&nbsp;I knew my&nbsp;parents would not care about my&nbsp;pregnancy and my&nbsp;child would constantly be&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s kids for his entire life. They’re due about 35&nbsp;days apart, but my&nbsp;sister is&nbsp;having an&nbsp;elective C-section and has moved the date back farther each month so&nbsp;that we’re now due six days apart.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d83/a16/8ddbbc5809afc1bf5a34c27a4f.jpg><p>«My&nbsp;friends and husband thought&nbsp;I was overreacting, until it&nbsp;was time for my&nbsp;baby shower. We&nbsp;live out of&nbsp;state, but my&nbsp;mom promised a&nbsp;virtual shower and we&nbsp;picked a&nbsp;date. I&nbsp;work a&nbsp;lot, so&nbsp;I figured it&nbsp;was handled. I&nbsp;followed up&nbsp;a&nbsp;few times and was told they were figuring it&nbsp;out, and then was like, „Oh, the date is&nbsp;almost here!“ I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was happening, but she didn’t answer.</p><p>The day of&nbsp;the baby shower came and nothing. And then, my&nbsp;mom texted me&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful, elaborate invitation to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s baby shower in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few weeks. That’s it. She never called me&nbsp;back or&nbsp;anything. I&nbsp;realized that she completely forgot about it&nbsp;altogether.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband no&nbsp;longer thinks I’ve overreacted, and we&nbsp;are now assuming neither of&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents will be&nbsp;coming to&nbsp;help with the baby or&nbsp;have much interest at&nbsp;all. I’ve worked really hard in&nbsp;therapy to&nbsp;forgive and learn to&nbsp;deal with my&nbsp;family because&nbsp;I want my&nbsp;son to&nbsp;have grandparents and cousins, but&nbsp;I don’t know if&nbsp;I want either of&nbsp;us to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family system where we&nbsp;don’t matter. I&nbsp;know how that feels already.</p><p>Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;overreacting or&nbsp;being hormonal? I&nbsp;didn’t help plan the shower and wasn’t adamant about&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I checked my&nbsp;texts and both me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband have messages from them saying they were doing&nbsp;it. Between my&nbsp;family issues/history and being pregnant, I&nbsp;just don’t trust my&nbsp;own judgement.»</p><p><h2>Although she was having doubts about her feelings, people in&nbsp;the comments assured she was right to&nbsp;feel neglected by&nbsp;her family and offered advice on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;it:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e9/35e/92438a521d80f3d0b7ccaa06e1.jpg><ul><li>You are not overreacting one bit.

She made beautiful invitations for your sister and did not even answer the phone when you attempted to&nbsp;contact her.
