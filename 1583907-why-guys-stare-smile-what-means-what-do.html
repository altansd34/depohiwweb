This happens and makes you feel unnerved or uncomfortable. Is he judging me? Or is he simply having a bad day? Such thoughts will race through your mind as you try to decipher the intentions behind the gaze.</p><h2 id=1583907-why-do-guys-stare-at-me-but-never-smile class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Why do guys stare at me but never smile?</h2><p class=align-left>For the most part, the stare from a guy isn't necessarily malicious or even deliberate. Like anyone else, a guy can get lost in his thoughts while having a hectic day. It could mean a guy is simply shy and apprehensive about introducing himself. It is the context that could offer more insights into the specifics.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0879a42b3d4ffe67.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"How can I get my crush to fall in love with me?"

Your hair, outfit, or presence could draw their attention.</p><p class=align-left>However, for most ladies, the lack of a smile adds mystery to the situation. Amidst the confusion, the first thought in your mind would typically be, "Why does he stare at me so intensely without smiling? Here’s a look at several potential meanings behind the stare.</p><h3 id=1583907-he-is-in-a-bad-mood class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>He is in a bad mood</h3><p class=align-left>What does it mean when a guy stares at you with a serious face? Chances are he is having a bad day or in an emotional tailspin. A guy can experience a tough day or even a series of them. A stressed mind can get him distracted or make him daydream.</p><p class=align-left>While it's easy to interpret his gaze as directed towards you, consider that he might be lost in thought about his problems while unintentionally looking in your direction. That doesn't necessarily reflect anything personal. Some don't even realise that they're staring.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f7ca38270931d92.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ compliments for men to bring a smile to their face</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0879a42b3d4ffe67.jpg><p class=align-left>He may not want to smile because of his <a href=#>negative mood</a>. So don't take it personally because you haven't done anything to provoke it. He is probably preoccupied with his emotions and happens to be looking in your direction.</p><h3 id=1583907-he-is-intimidated class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>He is intimidated</h3><p class=align-left>For some reason, you are intimidating him. He probably fancies your company but perceives you as out of his league. Your poised demeanour, confidence, and boldness make him insecure about approaching you. His shyness overwhelms his sense of assurance, and the idea of approaching you makes him anxious.</p><p class=align-left>Some guys feel intimidated by women they find attractive, and their natural response might be to stare but not smile. If you sense that he's intimidated by you, consider initiating a conversation with him instead. Approach him with a smile to create a friendly atmosphere.</p><h3 id=1583907-he-is-shy-or-introverted class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>He is shy or introverted</h3><p class=align-left>Not every guy is comfortable instigating conversations.

A guy often stares at you without a smile because he thinks you are beautiful. You likely have a <a href=#>feature</a> that's caught his eye, so the protracted eye contact is simply a tool to gauge your level of interest in him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f7ca38270931d92.png><p class=align-left>If you are interested and feel flattered by the attention, then there's no problem acknowledging it.
