Only three days later, their wedding took place. Their sudden marriage was a huge sensation in the media and shocked many people, including those who were close to the music star.</p><p class=align-left>Elton appeared to be as bisexual in 1976 during his interview, which he gave to The Rolling Stone. However, a lot of people thought he was actually gay, not bisexual, and that he is hiding his true orientation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c7ff5328c3bcf7b.jpg><p class=align-left>The wedding was luxurious and had music stars like Rod Stewart and Olivia Newton-John in the attending. John Reid, who was the ex-spark of Elton, was the best man at the wedding. There was a lot of expensive food, like lobster, lamb, salmon, beef, turkey, crab, oysters and other delicious things.</p><p class=align-left>The bride was wearing a custom-made dress and a pendant made of diamonds. The couple looked happy, and there was no denying that they looked beautiful together. The musician's publicist, Caroline Boucher, even let the public know that Elton John mother Sheila gifted the newlyweds a baby stroller.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/213538e58803e581.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring story of Hilaria Baldwin, the famous actor Alec Baldwin's wife</span></p></a><h3>Divorce and aftermath</h3><p class=align-left>Four years after the impressive wedding, the marriage fell apart, and the two decided to get divorced. They did not have any children together. The announcement of the split stated that they are divorcing on friendly terms.</p><p class=align-left>This birthed another wave of speculation about John's sexuality. The tabloids claimed that the marriage was only intended as a cover for his true preferences, and there was no romantic love between him and Renate. A few years later, the star publicly came out as gay.</p><h3>Renate Blauel today</h3><p class=align-left>Nowadays, Elton John is happily married to his long-time partner David Furnish, and they have two children together - Zachary and Elijah.

He admitted that he was struggling with alcohol and drug addiction back then. His inner addict thought that if having relationships with men does not make him happy, then he should marry a woman, and everything would change. However, his process of thought was not clear back then, and he ended up hurting Renate, which he has regretted for the rest of his life. He confessed that he loved her and considered her to be a great person.</p><p class=align-left>In 2017, he publicly supported gay marriage in Australia through an Instagram post. In this post, he explicitly mentioned his former wife, saying that he had a lot of admiration and love for her. He stated that throughout their marriage, he kept denying who he really was, and this caused feelings of pain to both of them. He also said that meeting his husband helped him to accept himself and feel free to be who he really is.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/31e86052808da8c4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The amazing life of New York socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ee35ab94d182abec.jpg><p class=align-left>Renate Blauel now is retired from the public eye for a long time.
