As such, Spencer is the maternal uncle of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.<p>Spencer was born in London on 20 May 1964 and named Charles Edward Maurice, with Queen Elizabeth II as his godmother. His parents were called Viscount and Viscountess Althorp, as his paternal grandfather, Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, was still alive at the time of his birth. Spencer had three elder sisters: Sarah, Jane, and Diana. Diana later became the Princess of Wales. His infant brother John had died within hours of his birth four years before Spencer was born. After his parents' divorce when he was four years old, Spencer was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read Modern History</p><p>Spencer worked as an on-air correspondent with NBC News from 1986 to 1995, primarily for the network's morning programme, Today, and NBC Nightly News. He wrote and presented the 12-part documentary series, Great Houses of the World(1994–1995) for NBC Super Channel. He also worked as a reporter for Granada Television from 1991 to 1993.</p><p>Spencer has written several book reviews for The Guardian and The Independent on Sunday as well as feature stories for The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph and American publications such as Vanity Fair, Verandah and Nest.</p><p>Upon his father's death on 29 March 1992, 27-year-old Spencer succeeded as 9th Earl Spencer, 9th Viscount Althorp, 9th Viscount Spencer of Althorp, 9th Baron Spencer of Althorp, and 4th Viscount Althorp. He also inherited Althorp, the family's ancestral seat in Northamptonshire. At the height of her emotional difficulties, he had refused to allow his sister Diana to live in a cottage on the Althorp estate - despite her pleas. Since 2009, he has restored Althorp, re-roofing it and restoring its entire exterior for the first time since the 1780s. He has also helped establish Althorp Living History, a handmade fine-furniture line reproducing pieces from the collection at Althorp. The Spencer family's wealth derived from their profitable sheep farming in the Tudor era.</p><p>On 31 August 1997, his older sister Diana died after a car crash in Paris and Spencer delivered the eulogy at her funeral service held at Westminster Abbey six days later. In his eulogy he rebuked both Britain's royal family and the press for their treatment of his sister. Spencer has ruled out the conspiracy theories regarding his sister's death, and called the alleged letter she wrote 10 months before her death in which she discussed her fears of a planned accident "just a bizarre coincidence rather than tied in with reality."</p><p>He was Member of the House of Lords from 29 March 1992 (the day his father died and he inherited the peerage) until the House of Lords Act 1999 excluded most hereditary peers on 11 November 1999.</p><p>It was reported in 2003 that Spencer had refused to allow his sister Diana to live at Althorp, despite her request. It was also reported that Spencer had accused Diana of displaying "deceitful" and "manipulative" behaviour which were characteristics of the mental illness associated with bulimia nervosa which Diana herself had admitted she suffered. Diana was eventually buried on Spencer's ancestral estate, Althorp, where he built a garden temple memorial and a museum to her memory, displaying her wedding dress and other personal effects. The museum was opened to the public in 1998 with all profits going to Diana's Memorial Fund, also set up by Spencer. At this stage, Spencer began writing a series of books dealing with the estate itself and with his family history, beginning with an account of his ancestral home, Althorp: the Story of an English Housepublished in 1998.</p><p>In 2003, Spencer founded the Althorp Literary Festival. Speakers at the annual event have included the authors Bill Bryson, Helen Fielding, Antonia Fraser, and Boris Johnson. In 2004, he presented two documentaries for the History Channel on Blenheim: Battle for Europe.</p><p>Spencer was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Northamptonshire in November 2005; the Spencer family have had a long association with the county, the home of the family seat, Althorp. Spencer is also a patron of the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club.</p><p>On 16 September 1989, Spencer, then known by the courtesy title of Viscount Althorp, married (Catherine) Victoria Lockwood (born 20 November 1965). The wedding was held at the Church of St Mary, Great Brington, and Darius Guppy was the best man. Two nieces, Emily McCorquodale and The Hon. Eleanor Fellowes, were bridesmaids.</p><p>Two nephews, Prince Harry and The Hon. Alexander Fellowes (son of Lord and Lady Fellowes), were page boys. Spencer and Lockwood, who had moved to Cape Town, South Africa, were divorced on 3 December 1997. Diana's death occurred while the divorce case was in progress; shortly after his divorce, Spencer moved back to the United Kingdom. The Earl has four children by Victoria Lockwood, three daughters and one son<span style=color:#222><span style=font-family:sans-serif>.</span></span><span style=background-color:#fff;color:#222;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:14px><br></span><br></p>Net Worth:<h3>Charles Spencer, 9Th Earl Spencer Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Charles Spencer, 9Th Earl Spencer's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>, Charles Spencer, 9Th Earl Spencer Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbXxyfo6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjJyfmqqcmsBuv8%2BepZydomKGtbSNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-money-does-charles-spencer-9th-html.html&text=How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Charles%20Spencer%2c%209Th%20Earl%20Spencer%20Make%3f%20Latest%20Income%20Salary&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-money-does-charles-spencer-9th-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-does-charles-spencer-9th-html.html&title=How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Charles%20Spencer%2c%209Th%20Earl%20Spencer%20Make%3f%20Latest%20Income%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-money-does-charles-spencer-9th-html.html&title=How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Charles%20Spencer%2c%209Th%20Earl%20Spencer%20Make%3f%20Latest%20Income%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-does-charles-spencer-9th-html.html&title=How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Charles%20Spencer%2c%209Th%20Earl%20Spencer%20Make%3f%20Latest%20Income%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-money-does-charles-spencer-9th-html.html&description=How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Charles%20Spencer%2c%209Th%20Earl%20Spencer%20Make%3f%20Latest%20Income%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-dean-ambrose-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Dean Ambrose Make?
