I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cut out of&nbsp;the car. I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wasn‚Äôt</a> seriously injured though, thankfully, but the other person unfortunately wasn‚Äôt doing too well, from what&nbsp;I saw before&nbsp;I was taken away to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. I&nbsp;was told to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the hospital overnight to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;I suffered from a&nbsp;concussion. I&nbsp;rang my&nbsp;husband and told him what happened. My&nbsp;MIL got the incidents mixed up&nbsp;when he&nbsp;dropped off our daughters (6&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;YO) to&nbsp;my&nbsp;MIL while he&nbsp;rushed to&nbsp;see&nbsp;me.</p><p>The next morning, my&nbsp;husband brought our daughters while&nbsp;I was awaiting discharge. Upon seeing&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;6-year-old busted into tears and said, ¬´I&nbsp;don‚Äôt want you to&nbsp;die.¬ª I&nbsp;comforted her and said I‚Äôm not dying, and&nbsp;I was very lucky. She then said Granny said she hoped&nbsp;I die so&nbsp;that they and my&nbsp;husband could come live with her. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I were shocked, and my&nbsp;12-year-old confirmed she heard her say that. My&nbsp;husband said he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;ring MIL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ee2/b5f/24e8e05b3c901350d792ab217c.jpg><p>When he&nbsp;came back into the room, he&nbsp;looked furious. But he&nbsp;didn‚Äôt say anything until after we&nbsp;got home, and he&nbsp;said that my&nbsp;MIL denied&nbsp;it, but after he&nbsp;kept pushing she admitted&nbsp;it. She said she didn‚Äôt mean&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;thought we&nbsp;were close. But I&nbsp;guess not.</p><p>I&nbsp;am incredibly hurt that she would want that. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I wanted me&nbsp;and the girls to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;contact with her. I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;husband that he&nbsp;could have a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her, but&nbsp;I don‚Äôt want me&nbsp;and the girls to&nbsp;have one with her. My&nbsp;husband said he&nbsp;supports&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;then rang MIL and told her what I&nbsp;said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c6/7ef/b96fef50909886da1d601b91c7.jpg><p>She didn't take it too well. She came to our house crying and said it was a misunderstanding, she didn't mean it, and we were taking it the wrong way. My husband asked what did you mean then?</p><p>She just got hysterical and started crying and saying she always wanted daughters, but my husband was the only child due to her not being able to have anymore after him, and that the girls are more like her daughters than granddaughters. She said she wasn't thinking properly when she said that to our 6-year-old. She got so worked up that my husband had to take her home.</p><p>When he got back he said he didn't know she felt like that and asked if I still wanted to cut her off. I said yes! He said okay and didn't argue. But it's been a week now, and he is still very quiet and hasn't said much about what happened, and now I'm starting to feel guilty and wondering if I did take it the wrong way.</p><p><h2>People stood by&nbsp;her side</h2></p><ul><li>"She <a href=# title=traumatized data-link=tag>traumatized</a> your child. It was horrifying for your daughter to hear that. Stand your ground. She needs at the very least a good LONG time-out.<br>Do not let your husband or anyone sweep this under the rug because doing that would make everyone think it's perfectly okay for MIL to hope you died, and for your daughters to lose their mom. That's sickening!" <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Laquila / Reddit</a></li><li>"You do realize that she told your husband that she didn‚Äôt want a boy.

I decided to talk to my husband and asked if he was upset that I decided that and the girls to have no contact with my MIL. He said he wasn't. He said he always knew that his mom wanted a daughter instead of him, and it brought back all the bad memories of rejection and hurt he felt growing up as a kid.</p><p>I suggested therapy and he's willing to go. We are also going to get therapy for our 6-year-old, as she now gets <a href=# title=anxious data-link=tag>anxious</a> if I'm not within her sight.</p><p>My husband agreed that going without contact with my MIL is the best thing for our family. Our daughter's birthday is coming up, and we have yet to tell her she is no longer invited. Not looking forward to that.</p><p><h2>Followed by an unbelievable turn of events.</h2></p><p>I didn't think I would be posting here again and thought my last update would be my last. But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>here</a> we are. My MIL has been arrested. My husband's cousin found my post and knew it was me, and she reported it straight to my MIL. She came over and screamed that we couldn't keep her daughters away from her.</p><p>My husband tried to calm her down and get her to leave. She wouldn't and attacked him. My husband had to restrain her and I called the police. She fought them, but it got her nowhere except the back of their car. The woman is truly insane.</p><p>My husband talked to the police because I had to calm down my daughters. After all, they witnessed the whole thing. My 6-year-old was hysterical about Granny being taken away. This is all just a big mess.</p><p><h2>Luckily, she had everyone‚Äôs back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/462/6f1/05cacc572eb25bf6917aa9262b.jpg><p>SO HAPPY YOU ARE STANDING FIRM ... my MIL made it perfectly clear that "I" ruined her sons life by having more than "1" child, in front of our children ALL THE TIME (3 daughters).
