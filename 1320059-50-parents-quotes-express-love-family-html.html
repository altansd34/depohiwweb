Here are some<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> quotes for parents</a> that apply daily:</p><ul><li>“Parents are like God because you want to know they’re out there, and you want them to think well of you, but you only call when you need something.”</li><li>“Family isn’t always blood. It’s the people in your life who want you in theirs; the ones who accept you for who you are.

They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter.”</li><li>“Everyone else we knew growing up is the same: image of their parents, no matter how loud they told themselves they’d be different.”</li><li>“Love your parents.
