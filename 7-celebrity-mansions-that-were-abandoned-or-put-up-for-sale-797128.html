There are actually many spaces that can inspire you, for example, the houses of&nbsp;celebrities. Their homes are usually full of&nbsp;fascinating details, and some appear to&nbsp;have come out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fairytale. However, some stars decide to&nbsp;sell them out of&nbsp;nowhere, and at&nbsp;very high prices. Despite the costs, when a&nbsp;house like this is&nbsp;available, it&nbsp;usually sells very quickly, except for some cases where no&nbsp;one wants to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;it, and it&nbsp;ends up&nbsp;abandoned.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>wants to&nbsp;share with you the stories of&nbsp;some of&nbsp;them. Some spent a&nbsp;long time in&nbsp;oblivion, others are still for sale, and some were remodeled into something else.</p><p><h2>1. Mike Tyson’s mansion in&nbsp;Southington</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d6b/c30/aa04ef58a8ba67890dd6343bb1.jpg><p>The house was built by&nbsp;Ted Vannelli, a&nbsp;politician from Trumbull County. <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a> <a href=#>bought</a> it&nbsp;for $300,000 in&nbsp;1989. However, years later, the boxer had some personal and legal issues that affected his career and lifestyle. Although he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;his career, problems regarding his inappropriate behavior kept coming to&nbsp;light. His house was full of&nbsp;<a href=#>luxuries</a>, from a&nbsp;basketball court to&nbsp;a&nbsp;large pool. He&nbsp;also owned <a href=#>3&nbsp;Bengal tigers</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;2003, Tyson was not in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good position financially so&nbsp;the mansion was sold to&nbsp;businessman <a href=#>Paul Monea</a>, but he&nbsp;never lived in&nbsp;the house. Ironically, the new owner also faced legal problems, and the estate became open to&nbsp;purchase again. In&nbsp;2010&nbsp;it was acquired by&nbsp;businessman <a href=#>Ron Hemelgarn</a>, who did some restorations to&nbsp;the mansion; however, he&nbsp;didn’t move in&nbsp;there either. After many months in&nbsp;abandonment, the property passed into the hands of&nbsp;the religious organization <a href=#>Living Word Sanctuary</a>. They worked on&nbsp;the house for 4&nbsp;years, only on&nbsp;weekends, to&nbsp;remodel&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/0e5/24b588572db14e05909d6fec68.jpg><p><h2>2. Bruce Lee’s mansion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ce/106/43de935e89877e8f83dd02ff9d.jpg><p>When <a href=#>Bruce Lee</a> passed away, he&nbsp;left a&nbsp;great legacy in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;movies, books, and objects that could be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;understand his training methods and his philosophy on&nbsp;life. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;left a&nbsp;<a href=#>mansion</a> in&nbsp;Hong Kong, where he&nbsp;lived his last year with his family. After his departure (1973), the house passed into the hands of&nbsp;businessman <a href=#>Yu&nbsp;Pengnian</a>. He&nbsp;was known as&nbsp;the “Love Hotel King” because many of&nbsp;his properties ended up&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=#>hotels</a>. So, even though people begged that the kung-fu legend’s mansion be&nbsp;transformed into a&nbsp;<a href=# title=museum data-link=tag>museum</a>, it&nbsp;was turned into a&nbsp;hotel by&nbsp;the late 2000s.</p><p>In&nbsp;2009, businessman&nbsp;Yu announced that he&nbsp;would remodel the place and make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;tourist center, but the plan wasn’t carried out because details were not fine-tuned, and he&nbsp;couldn’t come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;agreement with the government. Years later, in&nbsp;2015, Yu&nbsp;passed away. In&nbsp;2018, his grandson <a href=#>announced</a> that the place would be&nbsp;converted into a&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> to&nbsp;offer Mandarin and music lessons for children. But in&nbsp;2019, what used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Bruce Lee’s house was <a href=#>demolished</a>. A&nbsp;Chinese study center was built in&nbsp;its place. Some specific architectural details, like a&nbsp;mosaic and a&nbsp;few window frames, were preserved for posterity. Sadly, some YouTube <a href=#>videos</a> expose how abandoned this property was for many years.</p><p><h2>3. Aleister Crowley’s Boleskine House</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ef/36f/232abe59868fe92e9b4315fea5.jpg><p>This Scottish <a href=#>property</a> has survived the passage of&nbsp;time and even flames. It&nbsp;belonged to&nbsp;<a href=#>Aleister Crowley</a> and Led Zeppelin guitarist <a href=#>Jimmy Page</a>. Long before the writer moved into the mansion, the area already had a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;strange incidents that went way back into the 13th century. The place used to&nbsp;shelter a&nbsp;church and a&nbsp;cemetery. The legend maintains that the church caught on&nbsp;fire and left no&nbsp;survivors. The Boleskine Mansion was built in&nbsp;its place in&nbsp;the 1760s by&nbsp;Colonel <a href=#>Archibald Fraser</a> and was expanded by&nbsp;the Fraser family around 1830.</p><p>The house had 4&nbsp;bedrooms, all on&nbsp;the same floor, a&nbsp;kitchen, and a&nbsp;bedroom for the servants. In&nbsp;addition, it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;library, a&nbsp;hall, and some believe that it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;tunnel that connected the mansion to&nbsp;the cemetery. Crowley bought the house in&nbsp;1899, thinking it&nbsp;was perfect for performing special rituals. Some believe this is&nbsp;why mysterious occurrences used to&nbsp;happen there. Eventually, he&nbsp;left the property in&nbsp;1913. Despite all the stories surrounding the estate, Jimmy Page bought it&nbsp;in&nbsp;1970, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;collector of&nbsp;things related to&nbsp;Crowley. After restoring&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;left his friend, Malcolm Dent, who also experienced strange events inside the mansion, in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the house. Some chairs would change places, doors opened and closed all by&nbsp;themselves, and rugs rolled up&nbsp;without explanation. The owners, who followed him, left behind some of&nbsp;their own horror stories. In&nbsp;2015, the house caught fire, and was severely damaged. In&nbsp;2019 there was another fire, and much of&nbsp;the mansion was destroyed. The <a href=#>Boleskine Foundation</a> acquired the ruins that same year. They plan to&nbsp;restore the mansion to&nbsp;its original state and open it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the public.</p><p><h2>4. The Minnelli Mansion</h2></p><p>After the famous <a href=#>Vincente Minnelli</a> passed away, word got out that his last <a href=#>wish</a> was for the property, located in&nbsp;Beverly Hills, to&nbsp;pass into the hands of&nbsp;his daughter, <a href=#>Liza</a>. However, only under one condition: that Minnelli’s last wife (<a href=#>Lee Anderson</a>), the girl’s stepmother, could stay in&nbsp;the house until her death or&nbsp;until she decided to&nbsp;move. In&nbsp;addition, if&nbsp;Liza sold&nbsp;it, then she would have to&nbsp;move her stepmother into a&nbsp;retirement home. In&nbsp;the beginning, there was no&nbsp;problem, and Lee spent over 10&nbsp;years in&nbsp;that house. However, in&nbsp;2002, Minnelli tried to&nbsp;sell the mansion, and that’s when the problems arose.</p><p>After Liza attempted to&nbsp;sell the property, she and Lee got stuck in&nbsp;legal conflicts over the house. Although Minnelli had offered to&nbsp;transfer her stepmother to&nbsp;a&nbsp;condo, Lee preferred to&nbsp;take action and proceed legally. She accused her stepdaughter of&nbsp;cutting off her utilities and firing some of&nbsp;her service staff, which made her have to&nbsp;endure stressful, worrisome, and humiliating moments. For whatever reason, the accusation was dropped a&nbsp;month later. Lee continued to&nbsp;live on&nbsp;the property until she died in&nbsp;2009, although it&nbsp;was officially sold in&nbsp;2004, and Liza paid the new owners’ rent.</p><p>After Lee passed away, the house was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remodeled, but that day never came. Some <a href=#>YouTube videos</a> show the abandoned mansion and the last images available (2017) portray what’s left of&nbsp;what was once the Minnelli mansion. They also show that the place is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer accessible and that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;undergoing some work.</p><p><h2>5. Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f74/b73/39bced5c3dba3356a2a305b1f2.jpg><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t just a&nbsp;home, it&nbsp;was also an&nbsp;amusement park exclusively for the singer’s guests. The facilities were designed to&nbsp;entertain terminally ill children, and more than 2,700 acres of&nbsp;fun were opened for them in&nbsp;1990. <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> named it&nbsp;“<a href=#>Neverland</a>,” like the island from Peter Pan. It&nbsp;was his favorite place, and he&nbsp;regularly spent time there, enjoying life with his family and friends.</p><p>Located in&nbsp;California, the estate was like a&nbsp;dream come true filled with places for entertainment, like a&nbsp;movie theater, a&nbsp;zoo, and a&nbsp;theme park. Despite everything, in&nbsp;1993, the singer began to&nbsp;face legal problems and a&nbsp;house warrant. In&nbsp;2005, disputes continued, and he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the property. When businessman William Bone purchased Neverland Ranch, it&nbsp;was priced between $16.5 to&nbsp;$30&nbsp;million. In&nbsp;2015, it&nbsp;was sold for $100&nbsp;million. In&nbsp;2019, after the documentary Leaving Neverland, the value of&nbsp;the ranch went <a href=#>down</a> to&nbsp;$31&nbsp;million.</p><p><h2>6. Hook End Recording Studios, the mansion where Pink Floyd once recorded</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84c/7b5/db11b15351ace1611c4ba59103.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was bought by&nbsp;singer <a href=#>Alvin Lee</a> to&nbsp;make way for Space Studios. While he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the house, he&nbsp;managed several recordings there. Later&nbsp;on, the <a href=#>mansion</a> passed into the hands of&nbsp;Pink Floyd guitarist <a href=#>David Gilmour</a>, and it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;this house that parts of&nbsp;the album The Final Cut were <a href=#>recorded</a>. Gilmour sold it&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>Trevor Horn</a>, who put it&nbsp;up&nbsp;for sale after his son, Aaron and his wife had an&nbsp;<a href=#>incident</a> in&nbsp;the garden. Then it&nbsp;passed into the hands of&nbsp;<a href=#>Mark White</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;2017, the furnished property was reported to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;abandoned condition. Some people have even shared their own tours of&nbsp;the place in&nbsp;<a href=#>videos</a> uploaded to&nbsp;YouTube.</p><p><h2>7. Pablo Escobar’s Hacienda Nápoles (Naples Estate)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5aa/570/3dfe6d54d5aea432363abdd7c2.jpg><p>This <a href=#>hacienda</a> was built by&nbsp;<a href=#>Pablo Escobar</a> and his cousin after purchasing various estates, that together made a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;<a href=#>3,000&nbsp;hectares</a>. Immediately after closing the deal, the Escobars began beautifying the place by&nbsp;building rooms, roads, swimming pools, artificial lakes, and an&nbsp;airstrip, among other things. With time, a&nbsp;zoo, a&nbsp;bullring, race cars, and other attractions were added to&nbsp;the ranch to&nbsp;entertain guests. After his death in&nbsp;1993, the property fell into abandonment and disrepair, and it&nbsp;was repeatedly occupied by&nbsp;security forces.</p><p>After a&nbsp;long battle, it&nbsp;was confiscated by&nbsp;the Colombian government. It&nbsp;wasn’t until 2006 that a&nbsp;company proposed to&nbsp;buy the hacienda and transform it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;<a href=#>theme park</a>. A&nbsp;project that would turn the place into the <a href=#>Hacienda Nápoles Theme Park</a> began the construction of&nbsp;water attractions, museums, and a&nbsp;wildlife sanctuary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/332/c93/e006cd57729f76f356cb2c3342.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you had a&nbsp;mansion, what would make you abandon&nbsp;it?
