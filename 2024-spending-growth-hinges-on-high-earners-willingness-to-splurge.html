Personal consumption expenditures, the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ measure of aggregate <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>consumer spending</a>, have maintained positive annual growth since March 2021, providing a critical buffer against recession amid rapid interest <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>rate hikes</a> by the Federal Reserve beginning in 2022. A primary factor underpinning this expansion has been spending on services, a component that has consistently been the largest contributor to spending growth over the past three years.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While government data showed retail sales disappointed in May, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult’s spending data</a> suggests consumers may be pulling back on some services purchases as well. Excluding housing, U.S. adults said they spent 2.9% less on service categories in May compared with April after accounting for inflation and seasonal factors. Discretionary service purchases were among the hardest hit, as consumers seemingly trimmed some nonessential spending from budgets.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A monthly pullback on its own is not a reason to worry; however a sustained reduction in spending could put a drag on overall growth and increase the risk of an economic slowdown. Morning Consult’s data allows us to not only understand which categories are driving spending, but also which consumer groups are splurging or tightening belts. Layering in demographic-level detail allows us a deeper understanding of the near-term trajectory of spending.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong>High earners are driving spending growth</strong></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Breaking out Morning Consult’s consumer spending data by annual household income reveals stark differences in purchasing patterns. While the lowest income cohort has been paring back real spending on both goods and services since inflation began surging in 2022, adults from households earning $100,000 or more reported <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>robust growth</a> in services spending and steady levels of goods purchases. Middle income adults’ spending growth initially followed a similarly strong trajectory, but <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>tapered off</a> in recent months. Paired with the understanding that services categories have been the main driver of overall spending growth, these findings lend support to the notion that high-income adults are playing a crucial role in propping up aggregate spending.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It stands to reason that an individual consumer from a high-income household possesses more spending power than one from a lower earning household. However, there are a smaller number of households earning $100,000 or more than there are households who earn less than that. We estimated the aggregate effect of high-income adults’ spending per category by multiplying Morning Consult’s average per-household spending level by income group by the total number of households within that same income group as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Consumer Expenditures</a> survey, and then calculating the highest earners’ share of the total. This exercise showed that while high earners make up only about a third of total households, they are responsible for about 46% of total spending, and even higher proportions across many categories.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Importantly, services like recreation, education and travel are among the categories for which purchases are most strongly driven by higher earning adults. This cohort appears disproportionately responsible for determining the trajectory of services spending, the same component that has proved most critical to supporting spending growth overall throughout the current economic recovery.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong>Persistent cost of living pressures limit spending potential for lower earning households</strong></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There are several potential factors contributing to a more favorable spending trajectory for higher earning adults than that of lower income households. For example, high earners are more likely to have additional income streams outside of money earned from working, including investments in equity markets. A rallying <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>stock market</a> in recent months may have helped boost this group’s feelings about their personal finances, in turn encouraging spending.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Coming out of the pandemic, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>wealth inequality</a> appeared to narrow as stimulus checks and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>job market gains</a> appeared to disproportionately benefit lower income households. Since 2022, however, persistently elevated inflation quickly eroded savings buffers as purchasing power declined. By the time inflation cooled enough to allow income growth to once again surpass price growth in 2023, the cost of living had already risen to a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>painfully high level</a> for those with exhausted savings living paycheck to paycheck.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult’s data tracking consumers’ monthly ability to save helps illustrate this story: The net shares of consumers who reported having leftover monthly income after paying their expenses declined rapidly in 2022 as inflation took off. Even as inflation cooled throughout 2023 and early 2024, savings ability trended roughly flat for each income cohort rather than recovering to previous levels. Those earning less than $50,000 per year had by far the weakest savings ability, with a net share of 16% reporting leftover income in May 2024. In contrast, and even after a recent decline, 60% of those with at least $100,000 annual household income reported savings ability on net.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Disparities in <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>debt burdens</a> may also play a role in discouraging spending by lower income adults. Higher liabilities detract from future purchases, as debt-laden consumers must allocate a portion of their earnings toward paying off past purchases rather than new spending. At the same time lower earners were increasingly dipping into savings, so too was this group relying more on debt to cover expenses. Furthermore, lower earning adults tend to have weaker <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>credit scores</a> than their higher earning counterparts and, consequently, higher interest rates. The self-reinforcing cycle of lower earning households experiencing rising balances, elevated interest rates, and diminished savings to fall back on is likely contributing to the recently observed uptick in <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>delinquencies</a> on credit card debt.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In short, while this group continues to be supported to an extent by the surprisingly resilient labor market, lower earning Americans are an unlikely source for imminent spending gains. Higher earners remain in a relatively stronger <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>financial position</a>; any resurgence in summer splurging is likely to fall primarily on the shoulders of these consumers.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong>Rising housing costs for high earners may be a headwind for discretionary spending</strong></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">So far in 2024, high-income households have continued to support spending growth. From January through May, spending by this group has surpassed its 2023 level by 4.6%, compared with 3.3% growth for middle income adults and a 2.1% decline in purchases by the lowest earning cohort. Much of the disparity in spending growth over this period was driven by housing costs: High earners – who are relatively more likely to be homeowners – spent considerably more on this category so far this year, while low earners – many of whom are renters – reported declining housing costs on average.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Homeownership status as a differentiator makes sense in light of current housing market dynamics: While low supply and elevated interest rates continue to prop up the cost of buying, rapid supply growth of multi-family homes has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>dragged down rents</a> in certain parts of the country, enabling cost savings for renters.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As the single largest monthly cost for most households, spending on housing could play an important role in shaping purchasing patterns going forward. If tight homeownership conditions continue to put upward pressure on high earners’ housing costs, they may have less room in budgets to allocate to discretionary categories–including many services categories that helped <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>propel spending growth</a> in 2023.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult’s daily indexes tracking consumer sentiment suggests housing unaffordability may be a factor influencing high earners’ views on current economic and personal financial conditions. Since 2018, the National Association of Realtors’ measure of housing affordability and the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Index of Current Conditions</a> (ICC) for adults earning $100,000 or more have maintained a moderately strong negative correlation. Through the first few weeks of June, high earners’ ICC scores have been declining following an uptick in housing unaffordability this spring. Weaker views on current conditions could be a worrying sign for spending, adding to the risk of slower outlays by the high-earning consumers that have played an outsized role thus far in driving topline growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX2d9c4CMrKeeppSeu6h5xqumsKyYYrWqusaeqmannmK1qrPHZpyaqp6av7R51qKjpaGenLumv9Jmq6hlo6W5tr7Gng%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2024-spending-growth-hinges-on-high-earners-willingness-to-splurge.html&text=2024%20Spending%20Growth%20Hinges%20on%20High%20Earners%20Willingness%20to%20Splurge&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-spending-growth-hinges-on-high-earners-willingness-to-splurge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-spending-growth-hinges-on-high-earners-willingness-to-splurge.html&title=2024%20Spending%20Growth%20Hinges%20on%20High%20Earners%20Willingness%20to%20Splurge" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2024-spending-growth-hinges-on-high-earners-willingness-to-splurge.html&title=2024%20Spending%20Growth%20Hinges%20on%20High%20Earners%20Willingness%20to%20Splurge" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2024-spending-growth-hinges-on-high-earners-willingness-to-splurge.html&title=2024%20Spending%20Growth%20Hinges%20on%20High%20Earners%20Willingness%20to%20Splurge" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-spending-growth-hinges-on-high-earners-willingness-to-splurge.html&description=2024%20Spending%20Growth%20Hinges%20on%20High%20Earners%20Willingness%20to%20Splurge" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1582157-anime-femboy-characters-love-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="27 best anime femboy characters you know and love today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./18-heartthrobs-we-fell-in-love-with-in-the-90s-and-what-they-look-like-today-797307.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="18 Heartthrobs We Fell in Love With in the 90s, and What They Look Like Today">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
