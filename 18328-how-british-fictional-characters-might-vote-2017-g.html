This follows from a <a href=#>similar survey</a> conducted just ahead of the EU referendum that revealed Geraldine Granger (aka the Vicar of Dibley) and Basil Fawlty were Britain’s most pro-Remain and pro-Leave fictional characters.</p><p>The below figures are the proportion of Brits who think the fictional characters would vote for a party, i.e. they exclude those who say “don’t know” or “would not vote”.</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote Conservative: Sir Humphrey Appleby (91%)</strong></h4><p>Yes Minister’s senior mandarin Sir Humphrey is overwhelmingly seen as a Conservative voter, with 91% of Brits with a view having him down as a Tory.</p><p>Other prominent Conservative voters included Keeping Up Appearances’ insufferable neighbour Hyacinth Bucket (87%) and James Bond (83%).</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote Labour: Jim Royle (75%)</strong></h4><p>The Royle Family’s telly addict and serial couch potato Jim Royle is the character most seen as a Labour voter, according to 75% of those with a view. This is perhaps unsurprising given that the family are resident in the Labour stronghold of Manchester.</p><p>Other top Labour voters included Eastenders’ Pat Butcher (67%) and Bob the Builder (67%).</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote SNP: Groundskeeper Willie (46%)</strong></h4><p>Although he has lived in America for most of his life, The Simpsons’ Groundskeeper Willie <a href=#>is an avowed Scottish nationalist</a>. Almost half of those with a view seem to have picked up on this fact, with 46% saying they think Willie would vote for the SNP.</p><p>The only other character on the list who was seen as remotely likely to vote SNP was the Harry Potter series’ Professor McGonagall (at 11%).</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote Green: Doctor Who (29%)</strong></h4><p>Everyone’s favourite Time Lord Doctor Who is the most likely to be a Green voter, with 29% of Brits with a view believing he would back the party.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that Doctor Who is also the character that Brits are most likely to believe wouldn’t vote (tied with Ali G at 19%). This is a fair shout, given that the Doctor does not appear to have a fixed abode in any constituency, and presumably fails to meet the voting requirements of being a British citizen or indeed a human being.</p><p>Other top Green voters were Mr Bean and Mary Poppins (both 23%, although Mr Bean is seen as slightly more likely to vote Conservative or Lib Dem, while people think Poppins is much more likely to vote Tory).</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote Liberal Democrat: Bridget Jones (28%)</strong></h4><p>Technically three people – Bridget Jones, Geraldine Granger and Miranda – tied for first place in terms of the Lib Dem vote (at 28%), but we’ve given this one to Jones on the basis that the Vicar of Dibley and Miranda were both seen as marginally more likely to vote Labour.</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote UKIP: Joannie “Nan” Taylor (24%)</strong></h4><p>The Catherine Tate Show’s foul-mouthed cockney pensioner is seen as the most likely to vote UKIP at 24%. (Although almost twice as many people believe she would be a Labour voter at 45%).</p><p>Other prominent ‘Kippers were Fawlty Towers proprietor Basil Fawlty (16%) and Del Boy (15%) – although, as with Nan, both were seen as more likely to vote for other parties.</p><h4><strong>Most likely to vote Plaid Cymru: Fireman Sam (14%)</strong></h4><p>Fireman Sam, the most famous resident of Pontypandy, was seen as the most likely to vote Plaid Cymru at 14% of people with an opinion. Nevertheless, Brits were far more likely to see Sam as a Labour voter (52%) – perhaps unsurprising given that public sector workers are <a href=#>more likely</a> to vote for the party.</p><p>Postman Pat was the only other fictional character on the list seen as remotely likely to vote for Plaid Cymru, at 7%. Again, as with Fireman Sam, Pat is much more likely to be perceived as a Labour voter (51%).</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYW2Ac4SMoaawZZKntrW10qFkn6GTqbawusClZJygkaeupMDEq6pmpZmctbV51airnmViZX54ecY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f18328-how-british-fictional-characters-might-vote-2017-g.html&text=How%20British%20fictional%20characters%20might%20vote%3a%202017%20general%20election%20edition&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f18328-how-british-fictional-characters-might-vote-2017-g.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f18328-how-british-fictional-characters-might-vote-2017-g.html&title=How%20British%20fictional%20characters%20might%20vote%3a%202017%20general%20election%20edition" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f18328-how-british-fictional-characters-might-vote-2017-g.html&title=How%20British%20fictional%20characters%20might%20vote%3a%202017%20general%20election%20edition" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f18328-how-british-fictional-characters-might-vote-2017-g.html&title=How%20British%20fictional%20characters%20might%20vote%3a%202017%20general%20election%20edition" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f18328-how-british-fictional-characters-might-vote-2017-g.html&description=How%20British%20fictional%20characters%20might%20vote%3a%202017%20general%20election%20edition" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-horses-do-you-see-your-answer-can-reveal-a-lot-about-you-660610.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Many Horses DoYou See?
