But now, she’s facing the consequences of&nbsp;her choices and wishes she had never gotten involved in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p><h2>The woman felt confident that she was making all the correct decisions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/687/c52/630b225e0e986245942ae7c4fc.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 38&nbsp;years old, reached out to&nbsp;us with a&nbsp;heartfelt letter, pouring out her emotions. She began, “I’m stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where&nbsp;I feel lost. My&nbsp;life has taken an&nbsp;unexpected turn, and&nbsp;I wasn’t prepared for the crash of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dreams. It’s like something out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;novel, so&nbsp;I apologize for the lengthy letter, but&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;get this off my&nbsp;chest.”</p><p>She revealed that her partner, aged&nbsp;54, and she had a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> that didn’t start on&nbsp;fairgrounds. “My&nbsp;partner and&nbsp;I met six years ago at&nbsp;a&nbsp;team-building event organized by&nbsp;our companies. <strong>He&nbsp;was married at&nbsp;the time and had two children, aged 10&nbsp;and 15.</strong> I&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;family or&nbsp;kids, nor was&nbsp;I in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship then.”</p><p>Initially, they formed a&nbsp;close friendship that eventually blossomed into romantic feelings. She recounted, “He&nbsp;confided in&nbsp;me&nbsp;about his unhappy <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, assuring me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;planned to&nbsp;leave his wife once their kids were a&nbsp;bit older.”</p><p>Trusting his words, she fell deeply in&nbsp;love with him and was willing to&nbsp;wait for him to&nbsp;end his marriage. <strong>“After two years of&nbsp;being together, our affair was discovered</strong>, and things became incredibly difficult for a&nbsp;while,” she added.</p><p><h2>Following the breakup, things were progressing steadily.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/149/59c/72f5a0516da52fe3f00b8690a1.jpg><p>Continuing her letter, the woman shared that after their affair became known, they decided to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;together and start anew as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple.</p><p>“We&nbsp;were ready to&nbsp;build our own family,” she wrote. “<strong>His wife was understandably devastated</strong>, but she chose not to&nbsp;involve the kids in&nbsp;their dad’s affair. Out of&nbsp;respect for his family, we&nbsp;kept our relationship low-key for about a&nbsp;year.”</p><p>She added, “It&nbsp;wasn’t until a&nbsp;year later that my&nbsp;partner introduced me&nbsp;to&nbsp;his children. Initially, it&nbsp;was tough for them to&nbsp;accept their dad with someone new, but eventually, we&nbsp;all bonded. <strong>We&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;house together and began planning our wedding</strong>. The kids visited&nbsp;us regularly, and everything seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;falling into place perfectly. At&nbsp;least, that’s what I&nbsp;believed.”</p><p><h2>The man’s former spouse was going through a&nbsp;lot.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27c/134/c0d7505b479189da8c86c14323.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her letter, the woman recounted the difficult time her fiancé’s ex-wife went through after their separation. “<strong>My&nbsp;fiancé’s ex-wife struggled a&nbsp;lot after he&nbsp;left</strong>,” she shared. “She was a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom with part-time work, dealing with serious health issues and weight gain. She was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark place, feeling depressed and alone.”</p><p>“She reached out to&nbsp;my&nbsp;fiancé frequently, calling him, sending long emails and heartfelt texts, <strong>begging for another chance to&nbsp;save their family</strong>,” the woman continued. “It&nbsp;was heartbreaking to&nbsp;witness. My&nbsp;fiancé felt guilty, but he&nbsp;always stayed true to&nbsp;our relationship. He&nbsp;reassured me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;chose me&nbsp;and that he&nbsp;regretted the pain he&nbsp;caused her and the kids. He&nbsp;believed in&nbsp;moving forward, not looking back.”</p><p><h2>As&nbsp;the woman who was betrayed began to&nbsp;heal, it&nbsp;marked the start of&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the affair relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f48/22d/cec2ad5b8aab783d3c13bd55ec.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her letter, the woman shared a&nbsp;surprising turn of&nbsp;events in&nbsp;her fiancé’s ex-wife’s behavior. “Out of&nbsp;the blue, <strong>she stopped reaching out directly</strong>,” the woman recounted. “Instead, she asked my&nbsp;fiancé to&nbsp;<a href=# title=communicate data-link=tag>communicate</a> with her through a&nbsp;parenting app. His eldest son told&nbsp;us that whenever he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;his younger brother, his mom wasn’t around. For&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;relief.”</p><p>“Then, we&nbsp;learned something unexpected,” the woman continued. “My&nbsp;fiancé’s youngest son mentioned someone named ’Uncle P’ in&nbsp;conversations. It&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;fiancé’s best friends who had cut ties with him after our affair came to&nbsp;light. They hadn’t spoken since. Well, it&nbsp;seemed ’Uncle P’ and my&nbsp;fiancé’s ex-wife were now dating.”</p><p>“At&nbsp;the same time, <strong>I&nbsp;discovered&nbsp;I was pregnant</strong>,” the woman added. “My&nbsp;fiancé’s demeanor changed noticeably. He&nbsp;seemed stressed from work, especially after switching jobs. He&nbsp;started coming home late, always glued to&nbsp;his phone. His behavior was completely different from what&nbsp;I was used&nbsp;to.”</p><p><h2>The situation was becoming extremely dangerous.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/772/2c5/41af21581d8e6f7617343a205a.jpg><p>pos accused his wife of having an affair when HE HAD AN AFFAIR!!! HUGE FACEPALM</p><p>In&nbsp;her heartfelt account, the woman shared a&nbsp;distressing incident that unfolded just two months ago. “<strong>I&nbsp;received a&nbsp;call from my&nbsp;partner, he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;the police station, and he&nbsp;needed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;pick him&nbsp;up</strong>,” she recounted. “It&nbsp;turned out he&nbsp;had gone to&nbsp;his ex-wife’s house late at&nbsp;night and got into a&nbsp;physical altercation with his former friend. He&nbsp;even accused his ex-wife of&nbsp;having an&nbsp;affair with his once-best friend.”</p><p>“My&nbsp;partner had a&nbsp;complete breakdown,” the woman continued, her voice filled with concern. “It&nbsp;was unlike anything&nbsp;I had ever seen. He’s always been so&nbsp;composed, but suddenly, he&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;different person. <strong>He&nbsp;became fixated on&nbsp;his ex-wife</strong>, constantly checking her <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, and interrogating his kids and family about her whereabouts.”</p><p>Despite the turmoil, the woman disclosed that her partner had agreed to&nbsp;seek therapy and was currently undergoing treatment. However, she admitted that their relationship remained strained, even after the birth of&nbsp;their child.</p><p><h2>She decided that leaving him was the right thing to&nbsp;do.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15c/832/be7af052d18f703ac36a7532e0.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;sense that his heart and mind are no&nbsp;longer fully invested in&nbsp;our relationship, and I’m contemplating leaving,” she confided. She also confessed that coming to&nbsp;this decision wasn’t easy or&nbsp;quick, saying, “<strong>I&nbsp;still have feelings for him</strong>. I&nbsp;held onto hope that things would improve over time, and we’d become a&nbsp;happy family. But he’s so&nbsp;distant now, showing no&nbsp;care for me&nbsp;or&nbsp;our child.”</p><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;gradual realization, but she recognized that things couldn’t continue like this, for her well-being and the sake of&nbsp;her child. “It’s painful, but&nbsp;<strong>I need to&nbsp;leave and focus on&nbsp;myself</strong>. I’ll fight to&nbsp;have custody of&nbsp;my&nbsp;child, and I’ll do&nbsp;everything to&nbsp;ensure we&nbsp;don’t repeat the same situation with my&nbsp;husband’s ex-wife.”</p><p>Dealing with situations like this can be&nbsp;really tiring. Another woman found herself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough spot when <strong>her husband’s ex-wife began asking for financial help</strong>. She even went as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;requesting them to&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>build a&nbsp;house for her and her kids on&nbsp;their property</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ec%2Baqa2mlad6rbHFrWShoaNixKqyxGadqKpdorJuus6wZKGdo2Kubq%2FOpqelnaSaubp5w6Kdn52imru1ec%2BeqaynnmKur7CMoqtmq5OWv6a%2FjKacZnBhbYVzgY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-partner-left-his-wife-for-me-now-hes-a-completely-different-person-and-it-scares-me-818825.html&text=My%20Partner%20Left%20His%20Wife%20for%20Me%3b%20Now%20Hes%20a%20Completely%20Different%20Person%2c%20and%20It%20Scares%20Me&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-partner-left-his-wife-for-me-now-hes-a-completely-different-person-and-it-scares-me-818825.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-partner-left-his-wife-for-me-now-hes-a-completely-different-person-and-it-scares-me-818825.html&title=My%20Partner%20Left%20His%20Wife%20for%20Me%3b%20Now%20Hes%20a%20Completely%20Different%20Person%2c%20and%20It%20Scares%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-partner-left-his-wife-for-me-now-hes-a-completely-different-person-and-it-scares-me-818825.html&title=My%20Partner%20Left%20His%20Wife%20for%20Me%3b%20Now%20Hes%20a%20Completely%20Different%20Person%2c%20and%20It%20Scares%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-partner-left-his-wife-for-me-now-hes-a-completely-different-person-and-it-scares-me-818825.html&title=My%20Partner%20Left%20His%20Wife%20for%20Me%3b%20Now%20Hes%20a%20Completely%20Different%20Person%2c%20and%20It%20Scares%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-partner-left-his-wife-for-me-now-hes-a-completely-different-person-and-it-scares-me-818825.html&description=My%20Partner%20Left%20His%20Wife%20for%20Me%3b%20Now%20Hes%20a%20Completely%20Different%20Person%2c%20and%20It%20Scares%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./remembering-the-best-dances-of-dancing-with-the-stars-season-30.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Remembering the Best Dances of 'Dancing with the Stars' Season 30">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./morgan-wallen-didnt-know-what-the-voice-was-when-he-auditioned.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Morgan Wallen Didn't Know What 'The Voice' Was When He Auditioned">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
