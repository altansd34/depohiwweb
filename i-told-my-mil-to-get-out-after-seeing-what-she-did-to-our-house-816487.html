I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;decent relationship with my&nbsp;MIL compared to&nbsp;many horror stories&nbsp;I hear from friends; she’s pretty sweet and warm. She&nbsp;is, however, a&nbsp;little over-controlling. Overprotective? I’m not sure of&nbsp;the exact word, but she has powerful ideas about things and no&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;boundaries.</p><p>For example, when she stays at&nbsp;our house, she takes over the kitchen entirely and insists on&nbsp;cooking all our meals. She cooks wonderfully, but she won’t let me&nbsp;help her at&nbsp;all, and she puts everything away in&nbsp;the wrong places&nbsp;— and then insists that her way is&nbsp;more logical. However, she only really comes for holidays, and&nbsp;I immensely like her. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t mind putting up&nbsp;with these mild annoyances.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/74c/47a/21b5bf565d9c91d43e1acbaf64.jpg><p>“I’m pregnant with our little girl, who will be&nbsp;born in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few months. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;miracle. I&nbsp;didn’t think it&nbsp;would happen, incredibly late, but we&nbsp;got lucky. When my&nbsp;MIL&nbsp;heard, she was super excited and said she would come over to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us get ready for the baby.</p><p>She offered to&nbsp;stay for the next 6&nbsp;months to&nbsp;help out because my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I both work long hours, and it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;handle the baby. She is&nbsp;also emotionally invested in&nbsp;this because she genuinely sees herself as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our family. She arrived a&nbsp;few days ago and set herself&nbsp;up, then she started with the cleaning.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e0/6a8/d99e2c5299a9fda7282223f5c5.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;like collecting things from garage sales and such. Many people would consider Things like little sculptures, books, baskets, and stuff utter junk. Our house is&nbsp;overstuffed, but it’s reasonably tidy and doesn’t seem like a&nbsp;hoarder’s house or&nbsp;anything. My&nbsp;MIL, on&nbsp;the other hand, likes everything surgically clean.</p><p>Yesterday, I&nbsp;came home from work to&nbsp;find the house like a&nbsp;fight zone. She went through my&nbsp;cabinets, cleared out everything she considered junk, and made several trips to&nbsp;Goodwill before&nbsp;I got home. I&nbsp;was furious and asked her why she would ever do&nbsp;this. She said the house has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tidy for the baby and that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;‘dangerous’ for the baby to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;cluttered house.”</p><p>“Then she took the next huge bag of&nbsp;stuff and tried to&nbsp;walk out the door. I&nbsp;lost it&nbsp;and told her she could get out right now. She was shocked that&nbsp;I was serious, and she said she didn’t have anywhere to&nbsp;go, and it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;late. It&nbsp;was about 9:30. I&nbsp;booked her a&nbsp;hotel room and called a&nbsp;taxi.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband came home an&nbsp;hour later, and when&nbsp;I told him what happened, he&nbsp;was furious with&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;says&nbsp;I disrespected his mom and was ungrateful for everything she’s trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;for&nbsp;us.”</p><p><h2>Reddit users shared their thoughts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2df/75c/22c43756d89c8bae94b960cb1a.jpg><p>True, MIL should not have thrown out her stuff BUT she didn't handle the situation well at all. Oh, I really love the part where she says MIL considers herself a part of our family. Well sister, she is whether you like it or not. By the way, do you have a mother and where is she? You and hubby should have sat down and had a talk with MIL and explained how you feel and what you could agree on and what you couldn't. You don't throw an old lady(that raised that wonderful man you married)out and say, "thats that".....nope! You need to apologize to her for the way you reacted and you and hubby need to talk to her.</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;mom cleaned my&nbsp;house once and threw away some stuff while&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;work (she was visiting and staying with&nbsp;me). I&nbsp;didn’t talk to&nbsp;her for almost a&nbsp;year or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;any family events that year. Those were not her possessions to&nbsp;be&nbsp;giving away. She must reimburse you at&nbsp;least, or&nbsp;I’d be&nbsp;filing a&nbsp;police report for theft. Her opinion of&nbsp;what a&nbsp;house is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like differs from yours; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;NOT her house and stuff, and as&nbsp;an&nbsp;old lady, she should have learned about this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, back when people were strict about manners. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>methinksdisdumb&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><ul><li>Your husband is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger problem here, though. He’s got to&nbsp;back you up&nbsp;and be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;set boundaries with his mother. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hill you should be&nbsp;willing for your relationship to&nbsp;die on&nbsp;because once the baby is&nbsp;born, it’s only going to&nbsp;get worse.<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i> </i></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ok-Profession-9372&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><ul><li>Show him this post. Tell him you will make a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;boundaries that she will not be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;cross if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;have her visit again, especially with the baby. Make sure your husband agrees because there will be&nbsp;big problems if&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t. Let her know the boundaries; if&nbsp;she crosses them, she will be&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;leave. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>doglover507071956&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/93f/d42/a2136e5390b78c7f4b1745d8f3.jpg><ul><li>My&nbsp;mom was a&nbsp;hoarder and would never admit&nbsp;it. Most hoarders won’t. You say most would consider what you collect junk and that your house is&nbsp;overstuffed but reasonably tidy. Red flags to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;think your MIL was trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what my&nbsp;sisters and I&nbsp;so often tried with my&nbsp;mom.<br>Once we&nbsp;realized after several conversations that my&nbsp;mom would not agree to&nbsp;us getting rid of&nbsp;things, we&nbsp;did it&nbsp;behind her back. I&nbsp;am talking about things like sneakers with giant rips along the side, electronics that didn’t work, things her cats had peed and shat&nbsp;on. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;dangerous environment for her and my&nbsp;dad to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in. You should have a&nbsp;neutral party come in&nbsp;and judge if&nbsp;you might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hoarder, and if&nbsp;so, start to&nbsp;get help for&nbsp;it, especially with a&nbsp;baby on&nbsp;the way. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>StandardBuilding0&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><ul><li>You have full right to&nbsp;set boundaries in&nbsp;your house, and it’s good you finally did. You could cross them more gently. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical overreaction when we&nbsp;don’t react for a&nbsp;long time when something annoys&nbsp;us. You blew&nbsp;up, whereas you could start&nbsp;— months ago&nbsp;— with gentle and kind boundaries. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hd150798&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>But who in&nbsp;their right mind invites their mom/mil to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;their house six months before the baby is&nbsp;due? That’s insane, sorry. And with what she previously did, her taking over was expected. (Not her throwing stuff away, that’s also insane.) <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Whooptidooh&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><p>Establishing positive relationships with your partner’s family can be&nbsp;challenging, especially when differences or&nbsp;<a href=#>conflicts</a> emerge.
