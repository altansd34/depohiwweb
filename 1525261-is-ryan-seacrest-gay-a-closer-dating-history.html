However, the social media personality's sexuality has been a heated discussion among his fans.

Learn more about his dating history.</p><h2>Is Ryan Seacrest gay?</h2><p class=align-left>Seacrest dating profile suggests that is straight. However, many have speculated that he is gay, after which he has always proven them otherwise. Furthermore, no single man is in his dating history, as he has always dated women.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0751c1c6afa54401.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Omah Lay, Young Jonn and other young male celebrities who have expressed love for Tiwa Savage</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ryan's fans suspected him to be gay because of many reasons. First, the social media star loves telling gay jokes. More than once, he has been quoted on his television shows making homosexual jokes with his co-hosts. For instance, there is a time <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> called Seacrest "Sweetheart" on one of the <i>American Idol</i> aired in 2014. He further encouraged Seacrest to "come out" of the closet jokingly.</p><p class=align-left>The other factor that contributes to the rumours of him being gay is his fashion sense and mannerism. For instance, Ryan grabbed a male audience member out of the crowd to dance with him during one of the <i>American Idol</i> show. Furthermore, many have noted that the radio presenter has feminine-like behaviours in that he makes confusing advances at men.</p><p class=align-left>There was an instance where Simon Cowell couldn't give a straight answer when he mentioned that Ryans's favourite song was <i>It's Raining Men</i>. This song is loved by gay brothers, referring to their favourite choice of partners. The statement brought forth more speculations that were still cleared by a clean dating history showing that he is into women, not men.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/704c3abf05f6c2f0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The real mama Zeh: 5 times Portable and wife have proven 'trenches love' is real</span></p></a><h2>Ryan Seacrest's dating history</h2><p class=align-left>Who is Ryan Seacrest dating?
