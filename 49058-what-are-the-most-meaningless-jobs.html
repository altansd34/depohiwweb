Most Britons (56%) <i>do</i> feel their job makes a meaningful contribution to the world.</p><p data-block-key=cmb68>This latest study is conducted with a much larger sample – 5,889 working Britons – allowing us to break the results down by industry to see in which fields the public believe their work has meaning and find their jobs fulfilling.</p><p data-block-key=2n2j9>Those who work in ‘medical and health services’ are the most likely to feel that their job makes a meaningful contribution to the world, at 80%, shortly followed by those in education, at 77%. Only 13% and 16% in these industries respectively feel that their jobs are meaningless.</p><p data-block-key=7ubmb>At the other end of the scale, those who work in retail and financial services are the most likely to say their jobs don’t make a meaningful contribution, at 53% in both cases. Those working in ‘hospitality and leisure’ are similarly disenchanted, at 50%.</p><p data-block-key=6han7>Only around a third (33-37%) of those in these occupations feel their jobs are making a meaningful difference to the world.</p><h3 data-block-key=asr7v id=in-which-industries-are-britons-most-likely-to-feel-fulfilled-in-their-job>In which industries are Britons most likely to feel fulfilled in their job?</h3><p data-block-key=8d6dk>More than two thirds of workers (69%) say they find their job fulfilling, compared to 29% who find them unfulfilling.</p><p data-block-key=a1hgh>At the industry level, we can see that at least half of Britons across all industries find their jobs fulfilling. Those working in the least fulfilling industries – retail, financial services, and hospitality and leisure – all tend to be fulfilled in their jobs, at 55-62%.</p><p data-block-key=3vaag>In fact, it is the field of ‘transportation and distribution’ that has the least fulfilled workers – while 51% say they find their jobs fulfilling, this is almost matched by the 48% who find them unfulfilling.</p><p data-block-key=1c2g9>Unsurprisingly, medical and education workers are once again at the top of the table in terms of job fulfilment, with 79% and 80% respectively finding their jobs fulfilling.</p><p data-block-key=d86bt>Combining the results of the two questions shows that overall, 49% of British workers say that their job is both personally fulfilling and making a meaningful difference to the world. Another 14% find their job fulfilling, but don’t think it makes a difference, while 7% thinks it does make a difference, but isn’t personally fulfilling to them. One in five (19%) say that their job is neither meaningful, nor bringing them fulfilment.</p><h3 data-block-key=ckxrb>In which industries are workers most proud of their jobs?</h3><p data-block-key=bbbo8>While 33% don’t think their jobs are meaningful, few are actually embarrassed by them. Only 5% say they would feel embarrassed to tell people what they did for a living, compared to 53% who would be proud.</p><p data-block-key=5jgtn>Retail workers are the most likely to be embarrassed by their occupation, at 11%, along with hospitality and leisure workers at 9%.</p><p data-block-key=b6vck>Again, medical and education workers are the most likely to be proud of their jobs, at 68% and 65% respectively.</p><h3 data-block-key=cp1jn>How many Britons are considering changing their job?</h3><p data-block-key=e1po4>With so many unfulfilled at work, it may be no surprise that a quarter of Britons seem to be considering changing their job. One in eleven (9%) describe themselves as “very likely” to change jobs in the next 12 months, with a further 16% saying they are “fairly likely”.</p><p data-block-key=77phs>The more unfulfilling Britons find their job, the more likely they are to think they will change it – while only 10% of those who are very fulfilled in their work say they are likely to change jobs in the next year, this rises to 37% of workers for say their job is “not very fulfilling” and 52% among those whose jobs are “not at all” fulfilling.</p><p data-block-key=4au49>Among those who consider their jobs meaningless, 36% say they are likely to change jobs in the next year.</p><p data-block-key=9tam3><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=6rcs0><i>Photo: Getty</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsaWWCeXnWoZitZZGnsm7Ax55kpqejqXquscCnoKefnJrAtHnJqJms</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f49058-what-are-the-most-meaningless-jobs.html&text=What%20are%20the%20most%20meaningless%20jobs%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f49058-what-are-the-most-meaningless-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f49058-what-are-the-most-meaningless-jobs.html&title=What%20are%20the%20most%20meaningless%20jobs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f49058-what-are-the-most-meaningless-jobs.html&title=What%20are%20the%20most%20meaningless%20jobs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f49058-what-are-the-most-meaningless-jobs.html&title=What%20are%20the%20most%20meaningless%20jobs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f49058-what-are-the-most-meaningless-jobs.html&description=What%20are%20the%20most%20meaningless%20jobs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./castilian-spanish.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Castilian Spanish? - Lingoda">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-10-famous-models-looked-like-when-they-were-kids-798205.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What 10 Famous Models Looked Like When They Were Kids">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
